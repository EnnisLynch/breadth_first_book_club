 But that you could think of doing anything so indecent!â€ â€œI didnâ€™t mean to do anything wrong.
 I only thought that we two ought to be together as we loved one another. No, I didnâ€™t even think that
 then. I only crept in to him, without thinking about it at all. Would you believe that I was so innocent
 in those days? And nothing bad happened either.â€ â€œAnd nothing happened even?â€ said Lasse.
 â€œBut itâ€™s terribly sad to think how things have turned out. It was the death of your father.â€
 The big woman began to cry helplessly, and Lasse was almost in tears himself. â€œPerhaps I ought never
 to have told you,â€ he said in despair. â€œBut I thought you must have heard about it. I suppose he
 thought that he, as schoolmaster, bore the responsibility for so many, and that youâ€™d thrown yourself
 at any one in that way, and a poor farm-servant into the bargain, cut him to the quick. Itâ€™s true enough
 that he mixed with us poor folks as if weâ€™d been his equals, but the honor was there all the same; and
 he took it hardly when the fine folk wouldnâ€™t look at him any more. And after all it was nothing at
 allâ€”nothing happened? But why didnâ€™t you tell them so?â€ Johanna had stopped crying, and now
 sat with tear-stained, quivering face, and eyes turned away. â€œI did tell them, but they wouldnâ€™t
 listen. I was found there of course. I screamed for help when I found out he didnâ€™t even know me, but
 was only flattered at my coming, and wanted to take hold of me. And then the others came running in and
 found me there. They laughed and said that Iâ€™d screamed because Iâ€™d lost my innocence; and I could
 see that my parents thought the same. Even they wouldnâ€™t hear of nothing having happened, so what
 could the other rabble think? And then they paid him to come over here, and sent me away to relations.â€
 â€œYes, and then you added to their sorrow by running away.â€ â€œI went after him. I thought heâ€™d
 get to be fond of me, if only I was near him. Heâ€™d taken service here at Stone Farm, and I took a place
 here as housemaid; but there was only one thing he wanted me for, and that I wouldnâ€™t have if he wasnâ€™t
 fond of me. So he went about boasting that Iâ€™d run away from home for his sake, and the other thing
 that was a lie; so they all thought they could do what they liked with me. Kongstrup was just married
 then, but he was no better than the others. Iâ€™d got the place quite by chance, because the other housemaid
 had had to go away somewhere to lie in; so I was awfully careful. He got her married afterwards to a quarryman
 at the quarries.â€ â€œSo thatâ€™s the sort of man he is!â€ exclaimed Lasse. â€œI had my doubts about
 him. But what became of the other fellow?â€ â€œHe went to work in the quarry when weâ€™d been at the
 farm a couple of years and heâ€™d done me all the harm he could. While he was there, he drank and quarreled
 most of the time. I often went to see him, for I couldnâ€™t get him out of my head; but he was always drunk.
 At last he couldnâ€™t stay there any longer, and disappeared, and then we heard that he was in Nordland,
 playing Hell among the rocks at Blaaholt. He helped himself to whatever he wanted at the nearest place
 he could find it, and knocked people down for nothing at all. And one day they said that heâ€™d been
 declared an outlaw, so that any one that liked could kill him. I had great confidence in the master,
 who, after all, was the only person that wished me well; and he comforted me by saying that it would
 be all right: Knut would know how to take care of himself.â€ â€œKnut? Was it Knut EngstrÃ¶m?â€ asked
 Lasse. â€œWell, then, Iâ€™ve heard about him. He was breaking out as wild as the devil the last time
 I was in this country, and assaulted people on the high-road in broad daylight. He killed one man with
 a hammer, and when they caught him, heâ€™d made a long gash on his neck from the back right up to his eye.
 The other man had done that, he said; heâ€™d only defended himself. So they couldnâ€™t do anything
 to him. So that was the man, was it! But who was it he was living with, then? They said he lived in a shed
 on the heath that summer, and had a woman with him.â€ â€œI ran away from service, and pretended to
 the others that I was going home. Iâ€™d heard what a wretched state he was in. They said he was gashed
 all over his head. So I went up and took care of him.â€ â€œThen you gave in at last,â€ said Lasse, with
 a roguish wink. â€œHe beat me every day,â€ she answered hoarsely. â€œAnd when he couldnâ€™t get
 his way, he drove me away at last. Iâ€™d set my mind on his being fond of me first.â€ Her voice had grown
 coarse and hard again. â€œThen you deserved a good whipping for taking a fancy to such a ruffian! And
 you may be glad your mother didnâ€™t get to know anything about that, for sheâ€™d never have survived
 it.â€ At the word â€œmotherâ€ Johanna started. â€œEvery one must look after themselves,â€ she
 said in a hard voice. â€œIâ€™ve had more to look to than mother, and see how fat Iâ€™ve grown.â€ Lasse
 shook his head. â€œI shouldnâ€™t care to fight with you now. But what happened to you afterwards?â€
 â€œI came back to Stone Farm again at Martinmas, but the mistress wouldnâ€™t take me on again, for
 she preferred my room to my company. But Kongstrup got his way by making me dairymaid. He was as kind
 to me as ever, for all that Iâ€™d stood out against him for nine years. But at last the magistrate got
 tired of having Knut going about loose; he made too much disturbance. So they had a hunt for him up on
 the heath. They didnâ€™t catch him, but he must have come back to the quarry to hide himself, for one
 day when they were blasting there, his body came out among the bits of rock, all smashed up. They drove
 the pieces down here to the farm, and it made me so ill to see him come to me like that, that I had to go to
 bed. There I lay shivering day and night, for it seemed as if heâ€™d come to me in his sorest need. Kongstrup
 sat with me and comforted me when the others were at work, and he took advantage of my misery to get his
 way. â€œThere was a younger brother of the farmer on the hill who liked me. Heâ€™d been in America in
 his early days, and had plenty of money. He didnâ€™t care a rap what people said, and every single year
 he proposed to me, always on New Yearâ€™s Day. He came that year too, and now that Knut was dead, I couldnâ€™t
 have done better than have taken him and been mistress of a farm; but I had to refuse him after all, and
 I can tell you it was hard when I made the discovery. Kongstrup wanted to send me away when I told him
 about it; but that I would not have. I meant to stay and have my child born here on the farm to which it
 belonged. He didnâ€™t care a bit about me any longer, the mistress looked at me with her evil eyes every
 day, and there was no one that was kind to me. I wasnâ€™t so hard then as I am now, and it was all I could
 do to keep from crying always. I became hard then. When anything was the matter, I clenched my teeth
 so that no one should deride me. I was working in the field the very day it happened, too. The boy was
 born in the middle of a beet-field, and I carried him back to the farm myself in my apron. He was deformed
 even then: the mistressâ€™s evil eyes had done it. I said to myself that she should always have the
 changeling in her sight, and refused to go away. The farmer couldnâ€™t quite bring himself to turn
 me out by force, and so he put me into the house down by the shore.â€ â€œThen perhaps you work on the
 farm here in the busy seasons?â€ asked Lasse. She sniffed contemptuously. â€œWork! So you think
 I need do that? Kongstrup has to pay me for bringing up his son, and then there are friends that come
 to me, now one and now another, and bring a little with themâ€”when they havenâ€™t spent it all in drink.
 You may come down and see me this evening. Iâ€™ll be good to you too.â€ â€œNo, thank you!â€ said Lasse,
 gravely. â€œI am a human being too, but I wonâ€™t go to one whoâ€™s sat on my knee as if sheâ€™d been my
 own child.â€ â€œHave you any gin, then?â€ she asked, giving him a sharp nudge. Lasse thought there
 was some, and went to see. â€œNo, not a drop,â€ he said, returning with the bottle. â€œBut Iâ€™ve
 got something for you here that your mother asked me to give you as a keepsake. It was lucky I happened
 to remember it.â€ And he handed her a packet, and looked on happily while she opened it, feeling pleased
 on her account. It was a hymn-book. â€œIsnâ€™t it a beauty?â€ he said. â€œWith a gold cross and claspâ€”and
 then, itâ€™s your motherâ€™s.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s the good of that to me?â€ asked Johanna. â€œI donâ€™t
 sing hymns.â€ â€œDonâ€™t you?â€ said Lasse, hurt. â€œBut your mother has never known but that
 youâ€™ve kept the faith you had as a child, so you must forgive her this once.â€ â€œIs that all youâ€™ve
 got for me?â€ she asked, pushing the book off her lap. â€œYes, it is,â€ said Lasse, his voice trembling;
 and he picked up the book. â€œWhoâ€™s going to have the rest, then?â€ â€œWell, the house was leased,
 and there werenâ€™t many things left, for itâ€™s a long time since your father died, remember. Where
 you should have been, strangers have filled the daughterâ€™s place; and I suppose those whoâ€™ve
 looked after her will get what there is. But perhaps youâ€™d still be in time, if you took the first
 steamer.â€ â€œNo, thank you! Go home and be stared at and play the penitentâ€”no, thank you! Iâ€™d
 rather the strangers got whatâ€™s left. And motherâ€” well, if sheâ€™s lived without my help, I suppose
 she can die without it too. Well, I must be getting home. I wonder whatâ€™s become of the future master
 of Stone Farm?â€ She laughed loudly. Lasse would have taken his oath that she had been quite sober,
 and yet she walked unsteadily as she went behind the calvesâ€™ stables to look for her son. It was on
 his lips to ask whether she would not take the hymn-book with her, but he refrained. She was not in the
 mood for it now, and she might mock God; so he carefully wrapped up the book and put it away in the green
 chest. At the far end of the cow-stable a space was divided off with boards. It had no door, and the boards
 were an inch apart, so that it resembled a crate. This was the herdsmanâ€™s room. Most of the space
 was occupied by a wide legless bedstead made of rough boards knocked together, with nothing but the
 stone floor to rest on. Upon a deep layer of rye straw the bed-clothes lay in a disordered heap, and
 the thick striped blankets were stiff with dried cow-dung, to which feathers and bits of straw had
 adhered. Pelle lay curled up in the middle of the bed with the down quilt up to his chin, while Lasse
 sat on the edge, turning over the things in the green chest and talking to himself. He was going through
 his Sunday devotions, taking out slowly, one after another, all the little things he had brought
 from the broken-up home. They were all purely useful thingsâ€”balls of cotton, scraps of stuff,
 and such-like, that were to be used to keep his own and the boyâ€™s clothes in order; but to him each
 thing was a relic to be handled with care, and his heart bled every time one of them came to an end. With
 each article he laid down, he slowly repeated what Bengta had said it was for when she lay dying and
 was trying to arrange everything for him and the boy: â€œWool for the boyâ€™s gray socks. Pieces to
 lengthen the sleeves of his Sunday jacket. Mind you donâ€™t wear your stockings too long before you
 mend them.â€ They were the last wishes of the dying woman, and they were followed in the smallest
 detail. Lasse remembered them word for word, in spite of his bad memory. Then there were little things
 that had belonged to Bengta herself, cheap finery that all had its happy memory of fairs and holidays,
 which he recalled in his muttered reverie. Pelle liked this subdued murmur that he did not need to
 listen to or answer, and that was so pleasant to doze off in. He lay looking out sleepily at the bright
 sky, tired and with a vague feeling of something unpleasant that was past. Suddenly he started. He
 had heard the door of the cow-stable open, and steps upon the long foddering-passage. It was the pupil.
 He recognized the hated step at once. He thrilled with delight. Now that fellow would be made to understand
 that he mustnâ€™t do anything to boys with fathers who could hold a man out at armâ€™s length and scold!
 oh, much worse than the bailiff. He sat up and looked eagerly at his father. â€œLasse!â€ came a voice
 from the end of the tables. The old man growled sullenly, stirred uneasily, but did not rise. â€œLas-se!â€
 came again, after a little, impatiently and in a tone of command. â€œYes,â€ said Lasse slowly, rising
 and going out. â€œCanâ€™t you answer when youâ€™re called, you old Swedish rascal? Are you deaf?â€
 â€œOh, I can answer well enough,â€ said Lasse, in a trembling voice. â€œBut Mr. Pupil oughtnâ€™t
 toâ€”Iâ€™m a father, let me tell youâ€”and a fatherâ€™s heartâ€”â€”â€ â€œYou may be a monthly nurse
 for all I care, but youâ€™ve got to answer when youâ€™re called, or else Iâ€™ll get the bailiff to give
 you a talking-to. Do you understand?â€ â€œYes, oh yes!â€”Mr. Pupil must excuse me, but I didnâ€™t
 hear.â€ â€œWell, will you please remember that Aspasiaâ€™s not to go out to pasture to-morrow.â€
 â€œIs she going to calve?â€ â€œYes, of course! Did you think she was going to foal?â€ Lasse laughed,
 as in duty bound, and followed the pupil back through the stable. Now it would come, thought Pelle,
 and sat listening intently; but he only heard his father make another excuse, close the half-door,
 and come back with slow, tottering steps. Then he burst into tears, and crept far in under the quilt.
 Lasse went about for some time, grumbling to himself, and at last came and gently drew the quilt down
 from the boyâ€™s head. But Pelle buried his face in the clothes, and when his father turned it up toward
 him, he met a despairing, uncomprehending gaze that made his own wander restlessly round the room.
 â€œYes,â€ he said, with an attempt at being cross. â€œItâ€™s all very well for you to cry! But when
 you donâ€™t know where Aspasia stands, youâ€™ve got to be civil, Iâ€™m thinking.â€ â€œI know Aspasia
 quite well,â€ sobbed the boy. â€œSheâ€™s the third from the door here.â€ Lasse was going to give
 a cross answer, but broke down, touched and disarmed by the boyâ€™s grief. He surrendered unconditionally,
 stooped down until his forehead touched the boyâ€™s, and said helplessly, â€œYes, Lasseâ€™s a poor
 thingâ€”old and poor! Any one can make a fool of him. He canâ€™t be angry any more, and thereâ€™s no
 strength in his fist, so whatâ€™s the good of clenching it! He has to put up with everything, and let
 himself be hustled aboutâ€”and say thank you into the bargainâ€”thatâ€™s how it is with old Lasse.
 But you must remember that itâ€™s for your sake he lets himself be put upon. If it wasnâ€™t for you,
 heâ€™d shoulder his pack and goâ€”old though he is. But you can grow on where your father rusts. And
 now you must leave off crying!â€ And he dried the boyâ€™s wet eyes with the quilt. Pelle did not understand
 his fatherâ€™s words, but they quieted him nevertheless, and he soon fell asleep; but for a long time
 he sobbed as he lay. Lasse sat still upon the edge of the bed and watched the boy as he slept, and when
 he had become quieter, crept away through the stable and out. It had been a poor Sunday, and now he would
 go and see if any of the men were at home and had visitors, for then there would be spirits going round.
 Lasse could not find it in his heart to take any of his wages to buy a dram with; that money would have
 quite enough to do to buy bare necessaries. On one of the beds lay a man asleep, fully dressed, and with
 his boots on. He was dead drunk. All the others were out, so Lasse had to give up all thoughts of a dram,
 and went across to the basement to see if there was any gaiety going among the maids. He was not at all
 averse to enjoyment of one sort or another, now that he was free and his own master as he had been in the
 days of his youth. Up by the dairy stood the three farm-laborersâ€™ wives who used to do the milking
 for the girls on Sunday evening. They were thick-set, small, and bent with toil. They were all talking
 together and spoke of illnesses and other sad things in plaintive tones. Lasse at once felt a desire
 to join them, for the subject found an echo in his being like the tones of a well-known song, and he could
 join in the refrain with the experience of a lifetime. But he resisted the temptation, and went past
 them down the basement steps. â€œAh, yes, death will come to us all!â€ said one of the women, and Lasse
 said the words after her to himself as he went down. Down there Karna was sitting mending Gustavâ€™s
 moleskin trousers, while Gustav lay upon the bench asleep with his cap over his face. He had put his
 feet up on Karnaâ€™s lap, without so much as taking off his shoes; and she had accommodated her lap,
 so that they should not slide off. Lasse sat down beside her and tried to make himself agreeable. He
 wanted some one to be nice to him. But Karna was unapproachable; those dirty feet had quite turned
 her head. And either Lasse had forgotten how to do it, or he was wanting in assurance, for every time
 he attempted a pleasant speech, she turned it off. â€œWe might have such a comfortable time, we two
 elderly folk,â€ he said hopelessly. â€œYes, and I could contribute what was wanting,â€ said Gustav,
 peeping out from under his cap. Insolent puppy, lying there and boasting of his seventeen years!
 Lasse had a good mind to go for him then and there and chance yet one more trial of strength. But he contented
 himself with sitting and looking at him until his red, lashless eyes grew watery. Then he got up. â€œWell,
 well, I see you want young people this evening!â€ he said bitterly to Karna. â€œBut you canâ€™t get
 rid of your years, all the same! Perhaps youâ€™ll only get the spoon to lick after the others.â€ He
 went across to the cow-stable and began to talk to the three farm-laborersâ€™ wives, who were still
 speaking of illness and misery and death, as if nothing else existed in the world. Lasse nodded and
 said: â€œYes, yes, thatâ€™s true.â€ He could heartily endorse it all, and could add much to what
 they said. It brought warmth to his old body, and made him feel quite comfortableâ€”so easy in his
 joints. But when he lay on his back in bed, all the sad thoughts came back and he could not sleep. Generally
 he slept like a log as soon as he lay down, but to-day was Sunday, and he was tormented with the thought
 that life had passed him by. He had promised himself so much from the island, and it was nothing but
 worry and toil and trouble â€”nothing else at all. â€œYes, Lasseâ€™s old!â€ he suddenly said aloud,
 and he kept on repeating the words with a little variation until he fell asleep: â€œHeâ€™s old, poor
 manâ€”and played out! Ah, so old!â€ Those words expressed it all. He was awakened again by singing
 and shouting up on the high-road. â€œAnd now the boy you gave me With the black and curly hair, He is
 no longer little, No longer, no longer, But a fine, tall strapping youth.â€ It was some of the men
 and girls of the farm on their way home from some entertainment. When they turned into the farm road
 they became silent. It was just beginning to grow light; it must have been about two oâ€™clock. IV
 At four, Lasse and Pelle were dressed and were opening the cow-stable doors on the field side. The
 earth was rolling off its white covering of night mist, and the morning rose prophetically. Lasse
 stood still in the doorway, yawning, and making up his mind about the weather for the day; but Pelle
 let the soft tones of the wind and the song of the larkâ€”all that was stirringâ€”beat upon his little
 heart. With open mouth and doubtful eyes he gazed into the incomprehensible as represented by each
 new day with all its unimagined possibilities. â€œTo-day you must take your coat with you, for we
 shall have rain about midday,â€ Lasse would then say; and Pelle peered into the sky to find out where
 his father got his knowledge from. For it generally came true. They then set about cleaning out the
 dung in the cow-stable, Pelle scraping the floor under the cows and sweeping it up, Lasse filling
 the wheelbarrow and wheeling it out. At half-past five they ate their morning meal of salt herring
 and porridge. After that Pelle set out with the young cattle, his dinner basket on his arm, and his
 whip wound several times round his neck. His father had made him a short, thick stick with rings on
 it, that he could rattle admonishingly and throw at the animals; but Pelle preferred the whip, because
 he was not yet strong enough to use it. He was little, and at first he had some difficulty in making an
 impression upon the great forces over which he was placed. He could not get his voice to sound sufficiently
 terrifying, and on the way out from the farm he had hard work, especially up near the farm, where the
 corn stood high on both sides of the field-road. The animals were hungry in the morning, and the big
 bullocks did not trouble to move when once they had their noses buried in the corn and he stood belaboring
 them with the short handle of the cattle- whip. The twelve-foot lash, which, in a practised hand,
 left little triangular marks in the animalâ€™s hide, he could not manage at all; and if he kicked the
 bullock on the head with his wooden shoe, it only closed its eyes good-naturedly, and browsed on sedately
 with its back to him. Then he would break into a despairing roar, or into little fits of rage in which
 he attacked the animal blindly and tried to get at its eyes; but it was all equally useless. He could
 always make the calves move by twisting their tails, but the bullocksâ€™ tails were too strong. He
 did not cry, however, for long at a time over the failure of his resources. One evening he got his father
 to put a spike into the toe of one of his wooden shoes, and after that his kick was respected. Partly
 by himself, and partly through Rud, he also learned where to find the places on the animals where it
 hurt most. The cow-calves and the two bull-calves all had their particular tender spot, and a well-directed
 blow upon a horn could make even the large bullocks bellow with pain. The driving out was hard work,
 but the herding itself was easy. When once the cattle were quietly grazing, he felt like a general,
 and made his voice sound out incessantly over the meadow, while his little body swelled with pride
 and a sense of power. Being away from his father was a trouble to him. He did not go home to dinner, and
 often in the middle of his play, despair would come over him and he would imagine that something had
 happened to his father, that the great bull had tossed him or something else; and he would leave everything,
 and start running homeward crying, but would remember in time the bailiffâ€™s whip, and trudge back
 again. He found a remedy for his longing by stationing himself so that he could keep a lookout on the
 fields up there, and see his father when he went out to move the dairy-cows. He taught himself to whittle
 boats and little rakes and hoes and decorate sticks with patterns cut upon the bark. He was clever
 with his knife and made diligent use of it. He would also stand for hours on the top of a monolithâ€”he
 thought it was a gate-postâ€”and try to crack his cattle-whip like a pistol-shot. He had to climb
 to a height to get the lash off the ground at all. When the animals lay down in the middle of the morning,
 he was often tired too, and then he would seat himself upon the head of one of the big bullocks, and hold
 on to the points of its horns; and while the animal lay chewing with a gentle vibration like a machine,
 he sat upon its head and shouted at the top of his voice songs about blighted affections and horrible
 massacres. Toward midday Rud came running up, as hungry as a hunter. His mother sent him out of the
 house when the hour for a meal drew near. Pelle shared the contents of his basket with him, but required
 him to bring the animals together a certain number of times for every portion of food. The two boys
 could not exist apart for a whole day together. They tumbled about in the field like two puppies, fought
 and made it up again twenty times a day, swore the most fearful threats of vengeance that should come
 in the shape of this or that grown-up person, and the next moment had their arms round one anotherâ€™s
 necks. About half-a-mile of sand-dunes separated the Stone Farm fields from the sea. Within this
 belt of sand the land was stony and afforded poor grazing; but on both sides of the brook a strip of green
 meadow-land ran down among the dunes, which were covered with dwarf firs and grass-wrack to bind
 the sand. The best grazing was on this meadow-land, but it was hard work minding both sides of it, as
 the brook ran between; and it had been impressed upon the boy with severe threats, that no animal must
 set its foot upon the dune-land, as the smallest opening might cause a sand-drift. Pelle took the
 matter quite literally, and all that summer imagined something like an explosion that would make
 everything fly into the air the instant an animal trod upon it; and this possibility hung like a fate
 at the back of everything when he herded down there. When Rud came and they wanted to play, he drove
 the cattle up on to the poor pasture where there was plenty of room for them. When the sun shone the boys
 ran about naked. They dared not venture down to the sea for fear of the bailiff, who, they were sure,
 always stood up in the attic of the big house, and watched Pelle through his telescope; but they bathed
 in the brookâ€”in and out of the water continually for hours together. After heavy rain it became
 swollen, and was then quite milky from the china clay that it washed away from the banks farther up.
 The boys thought it was milk from an enormous farm far up in the island. At high water the sea ran up and
 filled the brook with decaying seaweed that colored the water crimson; and this was the blood of all
 the people drowned out in the sea. Between their bathes they lay under the dunes and let the sun dry
 them. They made a minute examination of their bodies, and discussed the use and intention of the various
 parts. Upon this head Rudâ€™s knowledge was superior, and he took the part of instructor. They often
 quarrelled as to which of them was the best equipped in one way or anotherâ€”in other words, had the
 largest. Pelle, for instance, envied Rud his disproportionately large head. Pelle was a well-built
 little fellow, and had put on flesh since he had come to Stone Farm. His glossy skin was stretched smoothly
 over his body, and was of a warm, sunburnt color. Rud had a thin neck in proportion to his head, and his
 forehead was angular and covered with scars, the results of innumerable falls. He had not full command
 of all his limbs, and was always knocking and bruising himself; there were blue, livid patches all
 over him that were slow to disappear, for he had flesh that did not heal easily. But he was not so open
 in his envy as Pelle. He asserted himself by boasting of his defects until he made them out to be sheer
 achievements; so that Pelle ended by envying him everything from the bottom of his heart. Rud had
 not Pelleâ€™s quick perception of things, but he had more instinct, and on certain points possessed
 quite a talent in anticipating what Pelle only learned by experience. He was already avaricious
 to a certain extent, and suspicious without connecting any definite thoughts with it. He ate the
 lionâ€™s share of the food, and had a variety of ways of getting out of doing the work. Behind their
 play there lay, clothed in the most childish forms, a struggle for the supremacy, and for the present
 Pelle was the one who came off second best. In an emergency, Rud always knew how to appeal to his good
 qualities and turn them to his own advantage. And through all this they were the best friends in the
 world, and were quite inseparable. Pelle was always looking toward â€œthe Sowâ€™sâ€ cottage when
 he was alone, and Rud ran off from home as soon as he saw his opportunity. It had rained hard in the course
 of the morning, in spite of Lasse, and Pelle was wet through. Now the blue-black cloud was drawing
 away over the sea, and the boats lay in the middle of it with all their red sails set, and yet motionless.
 The sunlight flashed and glittered on wet surfaces, making everything look bright; and Pelle hung
 his clothes on a dwarf fir to dry. He was cold, and crept close up to Peter, the biggest of the bullocks,
 as he lay chewing the cud. The animal was steaming, but Pelle could not bring warmth into his extremities,
 where the cold had taken hold. His teeth chattered, too, and he was shivering. And even now there was
 one of the cows that would not let him have any peace. Every time he had snuggled right in under the bullock
 and was beginning to get a little warmer, the cow strayed away over the northern boundary. There was
 nothing but sand there, but when it was a calf there had been a patch of mixed crops, and it still remembered
 that. It was one of two cows that had been turned out of the dairy-herd on account of their dryness.
 They were ill-tempered creatures, always discontented and doing some mischief or other; and Pelle
 detested them heartily. They were two regular termagants, upon which even thrashing made no impression.
 The one was a savage beast, that would suddenly begin stamping and bellowing like a mad bull in the
 middle of grazing, and, if Pelle went toward it, wanted to toss him; and when it saw its opportunity,
 it would eat up the cloth in which Pelleâ€™s dinner was wrapped. The other was old and had crumpled
 horns that pointed in toward its eyes, one of which had a white pupil. It was the noisy one that was now
 at its tricks. Every other minute Pelle had to get up and shout: â€œHi, Blakka, you villainous beast!
 Just you come back!â€ He was hoarse with anger, and at last his patience gave way, and he caught up
 a big stick and began to chase the cow. As soon as it saw his intention, it set off at a run up toward the
 farm, and Pelle had to make a wide circle to turn it down to the herd again. Then it ran at full gallop
 in and out among the other animals, the herd became confused and ran hither and thither, and Pelle
 had to relinquish his pursuit for a time while he gathered them together. But then he began again at
 once. He was boiling with rage, and leaped about like an indiarubber ball, his naked body flashing
 in loops and curves upon the green grass. He was only a few yards from the cow, but the distance remained
 the same; he could not catch her up to-day. He stopped up by the rye-field, and the cow stood still almost
 at the same moment. It snapped at a few ears, and moved its head slowly to choose its direction. In a
 couple of leaps Pelle was up to it and had hold of its tail. He hit it over the nose with his cudgel, it
 turned quickly away from the rye, and set off at a flying pace down toward the others, while blows rained
 down upon its bony prominences. Every stroke echoed back from the dunes like blows upon the trunk
 of a tree, and made Pelle swell with pride. The cow tried to shake Pelle off as it ran, but he was not to
 be got rid of; it crossed the brook in long bounds, backward and forward, with Pelle almost floating
 through the air; but the blows continued to rain down upon it. Then it grew tired and began to slacken
 its pace; and at last it came to a standstill, coughed, and resigned itself to the thrashing. Pelle
 threw himself flat upon his face, and panted. Ha, ha! _That_ had made him warm! Now that beast shouldâ€”He
 rolled suddenly over on to his side with a start. The bailiff! But it was a strange man with a beard who
 stood over him, looking at him with serious eyes. The stranger went on gazing at him for a long time
 without saying anything, and Pelle grew more and more uneasy under his scrutiny; he had the sun right
 in his eyes too, if he tried to return the manâ€™s gaze, and the cow still stood there coughing. â€œWhat
 do you think the bailiff will say?â€ asked the man at last, quietly. â€œI donâ€™t think heâ€™s seen
 it,â€ whispered Pelle, looking timidly round. â€œBut God has seen it, for He sees everything. And
 He has led me here to stop the evil in you while thereâ€™s still time. Wouldnâ€™t you like to be Godâ€™s
 child?â€ The man sat down beside him and took his hand. Pelle sat tugging at the grass and wishing
 he had had his clothes on. â€œAnd you must never forget that God sees everything you do; even in the
 darkest night He sees. We are always walking in Godâ€™s sight. But come now, itâ€™s unseemly to run
 about naked!â€ And the man took him by the hand and led him to his clothes, and then, going across to
 the north side, he gathered the herd together while Pelle dressed himself. The wicked cow was over
 there again already, and had drawn a few of the others after it. Pelle watched the man in surprise;
 he drove the animals back quite quietly, neither using stones nor shouting. Before he got back, Blakka
 had once more crossed the boundary; but he turned and brought her back again just as gently as before.
 â€œThatâ€™s not an easy cow to manage,â€ he said kindly, when he returned; â€œbut youâ€™ve got young
 legs. Shanâ€™t we agree to burn that?â€ he asked, picking up the thick cudgel, â€œand do what we have
 to do with just our hands? God will always help you when youâ€™re in difficulties. And if you want to
 be a true child of God, you must tell the bailiff this evening what you didâ€”and take your punishment.â€
 He placed his hand upon Pelleâ€™s head, and looked at him with that unendurable gaze; and then he left
 him, taking the stick with him. For a long time Pelle followed him with his eyes. So that was what a man
 looked like, who was sent by God to warn you! Now he knew, and it would be some time before he chased a
 cow like that again. But go to the bailiff, and tell of himself, and get the whip-lash on his bare legs?
 Not if he knew it! Rather than that, God would have to be angryâ€”if it was really true that He could
 see everything? It couldnâ€™t be worse than the bailiff, anyhow. All that morning he was very quiet.
 He felt the manâ€™s eyes upon him in everything he did, and it robbed him of his confidence. He silently
 tested things, and saw everything in a new light; it was best not to make a noise, if you were always
 walking in the sight of God. He did not go on cracking his cattle-whip, but meditated a little on whether
 he should burn that too. But a little before midday Rud appeared, and the whole incident was forgotten.
 Rud was smoking a bit of cane that he had cut off the piece his mother used for cleaning the stove-pipes,
 and Pelle bartered some of his dinner for a few pulls at it. First they seated themselves astride the
 bullock Cupid, which was lying chewing the cud. It went on calmly chewing with closed eyes, until
 Rud put the glowing cane to the root of its tail, when it rose hastily, both boys rolling over its head.
 They laughed and boasted to one another of the somersault they had turned, as they went up on to the
 high ground to look for blackberries. Thence they went to some birdsâ€™ nests in the small firs, and
 last of all they set about their best gameâ€”digging up mice-nests. Pelle knew every mouse-hole
 in the meadow, and they lay down and examined them carefully. â€œHereâ€™s one that has mice in it,â€
 said Rud. â€œLook, hereâ€™s their dunghill!â€ â€œYes, that smells of mouse,â€ said Pelle, putting
 his nose to the hole. â€œAnd the blades of grass turn outward, so the old ones must be out.â€ With Pelleâ€™s
 knife they cut away the turf, and set to work eagerly to dig with two pieces of pot. The soil flew about
 their heads as they talked and laughed. â€œMy word, how fast weâ€™re getting on!â€ â€œYes; StrÃ¶m
 couldnâ€™t work as fast!â€ StrÃ¶m was a famous worker who got twenty-five Ã¶res a day more than other
 autumn farm-hands, and his example was used as an incentive to coax work out of the laborers. â€œWe
 shall soon get right into the inside of the earth.â€ â€œWell, but itâ€™s burning hot in there.â€
 â€œOh, nonsense: is it?â€ Pelle paused doubtfully in his digging. â€œYes, the schoolmaster says
 so.â€ The boys hesitated and put their hands down into the hole. Yes, it was warm at the bottomâ€”so
 warm that Pelle found it necessary to pull out his hand and say: â€œOh, my word!â€ They considered
 a little, and then went on scraping out the hole as carefully as if their lives depended on it. In a little
 while straw appeared in the passage, and in a moment the internal heat of the earth was forgotten.
 In less than a minute they had uncovered the nest, and laid the little pink, new-born mice out on the
 grass. They looked like half-hatched birds. â€œThey _are_ ugly,â€ said Pelle, who did not quite
 like taking hold of them, but was ashamed not to do so. â€œTheyâ€™re much nastier to touch than toads.
 I believe theyâ€™re poisonous.â€ Rud lay pinching them between his fingers. â€œPoisonous! Donâ€™t
 be silly! Why, they havenâ€™t any teeth! There are no bones in them at all; Iâ€™m sure you could eat
 them quite well.â€ â€œPah! Beastly!â€ Pelle spat on the ground. â€œI shouldnâ€™t be at all afraid
 of biting one; would you?â€ Rud lifted a little mouse up toward his mouth. â€œAfraid? Of course Iâ€™m
 not afraidâ€”butâ€”â€ Pelle hesitated. â€œNo, youâ€™re afraid, because youâ€™re a blue-bag!â€
 Now this nickname really only applied to boys who were afraid of water, but Pelle quickly seized one
 of the little mice, and held it up to his mouth, at exactly the same distance from his lips that Rud was
 from his. â€œYou can see for yourself!â€ he cried, in an offended tone. Rud went on talking, with
 many gestures. â€œYouâ€™re afraid,â€ he said, â€œand itâ€™s because youâ€™re Swedish. But when
 youâ€™re afraid, you should just shut your eyesâ€”soâ€”and open your mouth. Then you pretend to
 put the mouse right into your mouth, and thenâ€”â€ Rud had his mouth wide open, and held his hand close
 to his mouth; Pelle was under his influence, and imitated his movementsâ€”â€œand thenâ€”â€ Pelle
 received a blow that sent the little mouse halfway down his throat. He retched and spat; and then his
 hands fumbled in the grass and got hold of a stone. But by the time he was on his feet and was going to throw
 it, Rud was far away up the fields. â€œI must go home now!â€ he shouted innocently. â€œThereâ€™s
 something Iâ€™ve got to help mother with.â€ Pelle did not love solitude, and the prospect of a blockade
 determined him at once for negotiations. He dropped the stone to show his serious wish for a reconciliation,
 and had to swear solemnly that he would not bear malice. Then at last Rud came back, tittering. â€œI
 was going to show you something funny with the mouse,â€ he said by way of diversion; â€œbut you held
 on to it like an idiot.â€ He did not venture to come quite close up to Pelle, but stood watching his
 movements. Pelle was acquainted with the little white lie when the danger of a thrashing was imminent,
 but the lie as an attack was still unknown to him. If Rud, now that the whole thing was over, said that
 he only wanted to have shown him something funny, it must be true. But then why was he mistrustful?
 Pelle tried, as he had so often done before, to bend his little brain round the possible tricks of his
 playmate, but failed. â€œYou may just as well come up close,â€ he said stoutly. â€œFor if I wanted
 to, I could easily catch you up.â€ Rud came. â€œNow weâ€™ll catch big mice.â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s
 better fun.â€ They emptied Pelleâ€™s milk-bottle, and hunted up a mouseâ€™s nest that appeared
 to have only two exits, one up in the meadow, the other halfway down the bank of the stream. Here they
 pushed in the mouth of the bottle, and widened the hole in the meadow into a funnel; and they took it
 in turns to keep an eye on the bottle, and to carry water up to the other hole in their caps. It was not
 long before a mouse popped out into the bottle, which they then corked. What should they do with it?
 Pelle proposed that they should tame it and train it to draw their little agricultural implements;
 but Rud, as usual, got his wayâ€”it was to go out sailing. Where the stream turned, and had hollowed
 out its bed into a hole as big as a cauldron, they made an inclined plane and let the bottle slide down
 into the water head foremost, like a ship being launched. They could follow it as it curved under the
 water until it came up slantingly, and stood bobbing up and down on the water like a buoy, with its neck
 up. The mouse made the funniest leaps up toward the cork to get out; and the boys jumped up and down on
 the grass with delight. â€œIt knows the way it got in quite well!â€ They imitated its unsuccessful
 leaps, lay down again and rolled about in exuberant mirth. At last, however, the joke became stale.
 â€œLetâ€™s take out the cork!â€ suggested Rud. â€œYesâ€”oh, yes!â€ Pelle waded quickly in, and
 was going to set the mouse at liberty. â€œWait a minute, you donkey!â€ Rud snatched the bottle from
 him, and holding his hand over the mouth, put it back, into the water. â€œNow weâ€™ll see some fun!â€
 he cried, hastening up the bank. It was a little while before the mouse discovered that the way was
 open, but then it leaped. The leap was unsuccessful, and made the bottle rock, so that the second leap
 was slanting and rebounded sideways. But then followed with lightning rapidity a number of leapsâ€”a
 perfect bombardment; and suddenly the mouse flew right out of the bottle, head foremost into the
 water. â€œThat was a leap and a half!â€ cried Pelle, jumping straight up and down in the grass, with
 his arms at his sides. â€œIt could just squeeze its body through, just exactly!â€ And he jumped again,
 squeezing himself together. The mouse swam to land, but Rud was there, and pushed it out again with
 his foot. â€œIt swam well,â€ he said, laughing. It made for the opposite bank. â€œLook out for the
 fellow!â€ Rud roared, and Pelle sprang forward and turned it away from the shore with a good kick.
 It swam helplessly backward and forward in the middle of the pool, seeing one of the two dancing figures
 every time it approached a bank, and turning and turning endlessly. It sank deeper and deeper, its
 fur becoming wet and dragging it down, until at last it swam right under water. Suddenly it stretched
 out its body convulsively, and sank to the bottom, with all four legs outspread like a wide embrace.
 Pelle had all at once comprehended the perplexity and helplessness â€”perhaps was familiar with
 it. At the animalâ€™s final struggle, he burst into tears with a little scream, and ran, crying loudly,
 up the meadow toward the fir-plantation. In a little while he came back again. â€œI really thought
 Cupid had run away,â€ he said repeatedly, and carefully avoided looking Rud in the face. Quietly
 he waded into the water, and fished up the dead mouse with his foot. They laid it upon a stone in the sun,
 so that it might come to life again. When that failed, Pelle remembered a story about some people who
 were drowned in a lake at home, and who came to themselves again when cannons were fired over them.
 They clapped their hollowed hands over the mouse, and when that too brought about no result, they
 decided to bury it. Rud happened to remember that his grandmother in Sweden was being buried just
 now, and this made them go about the matter with a certain amount of solemnity. They made a coffin out
 of a matchbox, and ornamented it with moss; and then they lay on their faces and lowered the coffin
 into the grave with twine, taking every possible care that it should not land upon its head. A rope
 might give way; such things did sometimes happen, and the illusion did not permit of their correcting
 the position of the coffin afterward with their hands. When this was done, Pelle looked down into
 his cap, while Rud prayed over the deceased and cast earth upon the coffin; and then they made up the
 grave. â€œI only hope itâ€™s not in a trance and going to wake up again!â€ exclaimed Pelle suddenly.
 They had both heard many unpleasant stories of such cases, and went over all the possibilitiesâ€”how
 they woke up and couldnâ€™t get any air, and knocked upon the lid, and began to eat their own handsâ€”until
 Pelle could distinctly hear a knocking on the lid below. They had the coffin up in a trice, and examined
 the mouse. It had not eaten its forepaws, at any rate, but it had most decidedly turned over on its side.
 They buried it again, putting a dead beetle beside it in the coffin for safetyâ€™s sake, and sticking
 a straw down into the grave to supply it with air. Then they ornamented the mound, and set up a memorial
 stone. â€œItâ€™s dead now!â€ said Pelle, gravely and with conviction. â€œYes, I should just think
 soâ€”dead as a herring.â€ Rud had put his ear to the straw and listened. â€œAnd now it must be up with
 God in all His gloryâ€”right high, high up.â€ Rud sniffed contemptuously. â€œOh, you silly! Do
 you think it can crawl up there?â€ â€œWell, canâ€™t mice crawl, I should like to know?â€ Pelle was
 cross. â€œYes; but not through the air. Only birds can do that.â€ Pelle felt himself beaten off the
 field and wanted to be revenged. â€œThen your grandmother isnâ€™t in heaven, either!â€ he declared
 emphatically. There was still a little rancor in his heart from the young mouse episode. But this
 was more than Rud could stand. It had touched his family pride, and he gave Pelle a dig in the side with
 his elbow. The next moment they were rolling in the grass, holding one another by the hair, and making
 awkward attempts to hit one another on the nose with their clenched fists. They turned over and over
 like one lump, now one uppermost, now the other; they hissed hoarsely, groaned and made tremendous
 exertions. â€œIâ€™ll make you sneeze red,â€ said Pelle angrily, as he rose above his adversary;
 but the next moment he was down again, with Rud hanging over him and uttering the most fearful threats
 about black eyes and seeing stars. Their voices were thick with passion. And suddenly they were sitting
 opposite one another on the grass wondering whether they should set up a howl. Rud put out his tongue,
 Pelle went a step further and began to laugh, and they were once more the best of friends. They set up
 the memorial stone, which had been overturned in the heat of battle, and then sat down hand in hand,
 to rest after the storm, a little quieter than usual. It was not because there was more evil in Pelle,
 but because the question had acquired for him an importance of its own, and he must understand it,
 that a meditative expression came into his eyes, and he said thoughtfully: â€œWell, but youâ€™ve
 told me yourself that she was paralyzed in her legs!â€ â€œWell, what if she was?â€ â€œWhy, then
 she couldnâ€™t crawl up into heaven.â€ â€œOh, you booby! Itâ€™s her spirit, of course!â€ â€œThen
 the mouseâ€™s spirit can very well be up there too.â€ â€œNo, it canâ€™t, for mice havenâ€™t got any
 spirit.â€ â€œHavenâ€™t they? Then how is it they can breathe?â€[1] [1] In Danish, spirit = aand,
 and to breathe = aande. That was one for Rud! And the tiresome part of it was that he attended Sunday-school.
 His fists would have come in handy again now, but his instinct told him that sooner or later Pelle would
 get the better of him in fighting. And anyhow his grandmother was saved. â€œYes,â€ he said, yielding;
 â€œand it certainly could breathe. Well, then, it was its spirit flying up that overturned the stoneâ€”thatâ€™s
 what it was!â€ A distant sound reached them, and far off near the cottage they could see the figure
 of a fat woman, beckoning threateningly. â€œThe Sowâ€™s calling you,â€ said Pelle. The two boys
 never called her anything but â€œthe Sowâ€ between themselves. So Rud had to go. He was allowed to
 take the greater part of the contents of the dinner-basket with him, and ate as he ran. They had been
 too busy to eat. Pelle sat down among the dunes and ate his dinner. As usual when Rud had been with him,
 he could not imagine what had become of the day. The birds had ceased singing, and not one of the cattle
 was still lying down, so it must be at least five oâ€™clock. Up at the farm they were busy driving in.
 It went at full gallopâ€” out and in, out and in. The men stood up in the carts and thrashed away at the
 horses with the end of the reins, and the swaying loads were hurried along the field-roads, looking
 like little bristling, crawling things, that have been startled and are darting to their holes.
 A one-horsed vehicle drove out from the farm, and took the high-road to the town at a quick trot. It
 was the farmer; he was driving so fast that he was evidently off to the town on the spree. So there was
 something gone wrong at home, and there would be crying at the farm that night. Yes, there was Father
 Lasse driving out with the water-cart, so it was half-past five. He could tell that too by the birds
 beginning their pleasant evening twittering, that was soft and sparkling like the rays of the sun.
 Far inland above the stone-quarry, where the cranes stood out against the sky, a cloud of smoke rose
 every now and then into the air, and burst in a fountain of pieces of rock. Long after came the explosion,
 bit by bit in a series of rattling reverberations. It sounded as if some one were running along and
 slapping his thigh with fingerless gloves. The last few hours were always longâ€”the sun was so slow
 about it. And there was nothing to fill up the time either. Pelle himself was tired, and the tranquillity
 of evening had the effect of subduing his voice. But now they were driving out for milking up there,
 and the cattle were beginning to graze along the edge of the meadow that turned toward the farm; so
 the time was drawing near. At last the herd-boys began to jodel over at the neighboring farms, first
 one, and then several joining in: â€œOh, drive home, o-ho, o-o-ho! O-ho, o-ho! O-ho, o-ho! Oh, drive
 home, o-o-ho! O-ho!â€ From all sides the soft tones vibrated over the sloping land, running out,
 like the sound of happy weeping, into the first glow of evening; and Pelleâ€™s animals began to move
 farther after each pause to graze. But he did not dare to drive them home yet, for it only meant a thrashing
 from the bailiff or the pupil if he arrived too early. He stood at the upper end of the meadow, and called
 his homeward- drifting flock together; and when the last tones of the call had died away, he began
 it himself, and stepped on one side. The animals ran with a peculiar little trot and heads extended.
 The shadow of the grass lay in long thin stripes across the ground, and the shadows of the animals were
 endless. Now and then a calf lowed slowly and broke into a gallop. They were yearning for home, and
 Pelle was yearning too. From behind a hollow the sun darted long rays out into space, as if it had called
 all its powers home for the night, and now poured them forth in one great longing, from west to east.
 Everything pointed in long thin lines, and the eager longing of the cattle seemed visible in the air.
 To the mind of the child there was nothing left out of doors now; everything was being taken in, and
 he longed for his father with a longing that was almost a pain. And when at last he turned the corner
 with the herd, and saw old Lasse standing there, smiling happily with his red-rimmed eyes, and opening
 the gate to the fold, the boy gave way and threw himself weeping into his fatherâ€™s arms. â€œWhatâ€™s
 the matter, laddie? Whatâ€™s the matter?â€ asked the old man, with concern in his voice, stroking
 the childâ€™s face with a trembling hand. â€œHas any one been unkind to you? No? Well, thatâ€™s a good
 thing! Theyâ€™d better take care, for happy children are in Godâ€™s own keeping. And Lasse would
 be an awkward customer if it came to that. So you were longing for me, were you? Then itâ€™s good to be
 in your little heart, and it only makes Lasse happy. But go in now and get your supper, and donâ€™t cry
 any more.â€ And he wiped the boyâ€™s nose with his hard, crooked fingers, and pushed him gently away.
 V Pelle was not long in finding out all about the man who had been sent by God, and had the grave, reproachful
 eyes. He proved to be nothing but a little shoemaker down in the village, who spoke at the meeting-house
 on Sundays; and it was also said that his wife drank. Rud went to his Sunday-school, and he was poor;
 so he was nothing out of the ordinary. Moreover, Gustav had got a cap which could turn out three different
 crownsâ€”one of blue duffle, one of water-proof American cloth, and one of white canvas for use in
 sunny weather. It was an absorbingly interesting study that threw everything else into the background,
 and exercised Pelleâ€™s mind for many days; and he used this miraculous cap as a standard by which
 to measure everything great and desirable. But one day he gave Gustav a beautifully carved stick
 for permission to perform the trick of turning the crown inside out himself; and that set his mind
 at rest at last, and the cap had to take its place in his everyday world like everything else. But what
 did it look like in Farmer Kongstrupâ€™s big rooms? Money lay upon the floor there, of course, the
 gold in one place and the silver in another; and in the middle of each heap stood a half-bushel measure.
 What did the word _â€œpracticalâ€_ mean, which the bailiff used when he talked to the farmer? And
 why did the men call one another _â€œSwedeâ€_ as a term of abuse? Why, they were all Swedes! What was
 there away beyond the cliffs where the stone-quarry lay? The farm-lands extended as far as that on
 the one side. He had not been there yet, but was going with his father as soon as an opportunity presented
 itself. They had learnt quite by chance that Lasse had a brother who owned a house over there; so of
 course they knew the place comparatively well. Down there lay the sea; he had sailed upon it himself!
 Ships both of iron and wood sailed upon it, though how iron could float when it was so heavy he did not
 know! The sea must be strong, for in the pond, iron went to the bottom at once. In the middle of the pond
 there was no bottom, so there youâ€™d go on sinking forever! The old thatcher, when he was young, had
 had more than a hundred fathoms of rope down there with a drag, to fish up a bucket, but he never reached
 the bottom. And when he wanted to pull up the rope again, there was some one deep down who caught hold
 of the drag and tried to pull him down, so he had to let the whole thing go. God â€¦ well, He had a long white
 beard like the farmer at Kaase Farm; but who kept house for Him now He was old? Saint Peter was His bailiff,
 of course!â€¦ How could the old, dry cows have just as young calves as the young ones? And so on, and
 so on. There was one subject about which, as a matter of course, there could be no question, nor any
 thought at all in that sense, because it was the very foundation of all existenceâ€”Father Lasse.
 He was there, simply, he stood like a safe wall behind everything that one did. He was the real Providence,
 the last great refuge in good and ill; he could do whatever he likedâ€”Father Lasse was almighty.
 Then there was one natural centre in the worldâ€”Pelle himself. Everything grouped itself about
 him, everything existed for himâ€”for him to play with, to shudder at, or to put on one side for a great
 future. Even distant trees, houses and rocks in the landscape, that he had never been up to, assumed
 an attitude toward him, either friendly or hostile; and the relation had to be carefully decided
 in the case of each new thing that appeared upon his horizon. His world was small; he had only just begun
 to create it. For a good armâ€™s-length on all sides of him, there was more or less _terra firma_; but
 beyond that floated raw matter, chaos. But Pelle already found his world immense, and was quite willing
 to make it infinite. He attacked everything with insatiable appetite; his ready perceptions laid
 hold of all that came within their reach; they were like the mouth of a machine, into which matter was
 incessantly rushing in small, whirling particles. And in the draught they raised, came others and
 again others; the entire universe was on its way toward him. Pelle shaped and set aside twenty new
 things in the course of a second. The earth grew out under him into a world that was rich in excitement
 and grotesque forms, discomfort and the most everyday things. He went about in it uncertainly, for
 there was always something that became displaced and had to be revalued or made over again; the most
 matter-of-fact things would change and all at once become terrifying marvels, or _vice versa_.
 He went about in a state of continual wonderment, and assumed an expectant attitude even with regard
 to the most familiar things; for who could tell what surprises they might give one? As an instance;
 he had all his life had opportunities of verifying the fact that trouser-buttons were made of bone
 and had five holes, one large one in the middle and four smaller ones round it. And then one day, one
 of the men comes home from the town with a pair of new trousers, the buttons of which are made of bright
 metal and are no larger than a sixpenny-piece! They have only four holes, and the thread is to lie across
 them, not from the middle outward, as in the old ones. Or take the great eclipse of the sun, that he had
 wondered so much about all the summer, and that all the old people said would bring about the destruction
 of the world. He had looked forward to it, especially the destruction part of it; it would be something
 of an adventure, and somewhere within him there was a little bit of confident assurance that it would
 all come right as far as he was concerned. The eclipse did come too, as it was meant to; it grew dark too,
 as if it were the Last Day, and the birds became so quiet, and the cattle bellowed and wanted to run home.
 But then it grew light again and it all came to nothing. Then there were fearful terrors that all at
 once revealed themselves as tiny, tiny thingsâ€”thank goodness! But there were also anticipated
 pleasures that made your heart beat, and when you got up to them they were dullness itself. Far out
 in the misty mass, invisible worlds floated by that had nothing to do with his own. A sound coming out
 of the unknown created them in a twinkling. They came into existence in the same way that the land had
 done that morning he had stood upon the deck of the steamer, and heard voices and noise through the
 fog, thick and big, with forms that looked like huge gloves without fingers. And inside one there
 was blood and a heart and a soul. The heart Pelle had found out about himself; it was a little bird shut
 up in there. But the soul bored its way like a serpent to whatever part of the body desire occupied.
 Old thatcher Holm had once drawn the soul like a thin thread out of the thumb of a man who couldnâ€™t
 help stealing. Pelleâ€™s own soul was good; it lay in the pupils of his eyes, and reflected Father
 Lasseâ€™s image whenever he looked into them. The blood was the worst, and so Father Lasse always
 let himself be bled when there was anything the matter with him; the bad humors had to be let out. Gustav
 thought a great deal about blood, and could tell the strangest things about it; and he cut his fingers
 only to see whether it was ripe. One evening he came over to the cow-stable and exhibited a bleeding
 finger. The blood was quite black. â€œNow Iâ€™m a man!â€ he said, and swore a great oath; but the maids
 only made fun of him, and said that he had not carried his four bushels of peas up into the loft yet. Then
 there was hell and heaven, and the stone-quarry where they struck one another with heavy hammers
 when they were drunk. The men in the stone-quarry were the strongest men in the world. One of them had
 eaten ten poached eggs at one time without being ill; and there is nothing so strengthening as eggs.
 Down in the meadow, will-oâ€™-the-wisps hopped about looking for something in the deep summer nights.
 There was always one of them near the stream, and it stood and danced on the top of a little heap of stones
 that lay in the middle of the meadow. A couple of years ago a girl had one night given birth to a child
 out there among the dunes and as she did not know what to do about a father for it, she drowned it in one
 of the pools that the brook makes where it turns. Good people raised the little cairn, so that the place
 should not be forgotten; and over it the childâ€™s soul used to burn at dead of night at the time of year
 at which it was born. Pelle believed that the child itself was buried beneath the stones, and now and
 then ornamented the mound with a branch of fir; but he never played at that part of the stream. The girl
 was sent across the sea, sentenced to penal servitude for many years, and people wondered at the father.
 She had not named any one, but every one knew who it was all the same. He was a young, well-to-do fisherman
 down in the village, and the girl was one of the poorest, so there could never have been any question
 of their marrying. The girl must have preferred this to begging help of him for the child, and living
 in the village with an illegitimate child, an object of universal derision. And he had certainly
 put a bold face on the matter, where many another would have been ashamed and gone away on a long voyage.
 This summer, two years after the girl went to prison, the fisherman was going home one night along
 the shore toward the village with some nets on his back. He was of a callous nature, and did not hesitate
 to take the shortest way across the meadow; but when he got in among the dunes, he saw a will-oâ€™-the-wisp
 following in his steps, grew frightened, and began to run. It began to gain upon him, and when he leaped
 across the brook to put water between himself and the spirit, it seized hold of the nets. At this he
 shouted the name of God, and fled like one bereft of his senses. The next morning at sunrise he and his
 father went to fetch the nets. They had caught on the cairn, and lay right across the stream. Then the
 young man joined the Revivalists, and his father abandoned his riotous life and followed him. Early
 and late the young fisherman was to be found at their meetings, and at other times he went about like
 a malefactor with his head hanging down, only waiting for the girl to come out of prison, so that he
 could marry her. Pelle was up in it all. The girls talked shudderingly about it as they sat upon the
 menâ€™s knees in the long summer evenings, and a lovesick fellow from inland had made up a ballad about
 it, which Gustav sang to his concertina. Then all the girls on the farm wept, and even Lively Saraâ€™s
 eyes filled with tears, and she began to talk to Mons about engagement rings. One day when Pelle was
 lying on his face in the grass, singing and clapping his naked feet together in the clear air, he saw
 a young man standing by the cairn and putting on it stones which he took out of his pocket; after which
 he knelt down. Pelle went up to him. â€œWhat are you doing?â€ he asked boldly, feeling that he was
 in his own domain. â€œAre you saying your prayers?â€ The man did not answer, but remained in a kneeling
 posture. At last he rose, and spat out tobacco-juice. â€œIâ€™m praying to Him Who is to judge us all,â€
 he said, looking steadily at Pelle. Pelle recognized that look. It was the same in expression as that
 of the man the other dayâ€”the one that had been sent by God. Only there was no reproach in it. â€œHavenâ€™t
 you any bed to sleep in then?â€ asked Pelle. â€œI always say my prayers under the clothes. He hears
 them just as well! God knows everything.â€ The young man nodded, and began moving about the stones
 on the cairn. â€œYou mustnâ€™t hurt that,â€ said Pelle firmly, â€œfor thereâ€™s a little baby buried
 there.â€ The young man turned upon him a strange look. â€œThatâ€™s not true!â€ he said thickly;
 â€œfor the child lies up in the churchyard in consecrated earth.â€ â€œOâ€”oh, indeâ€”ed?â€ said
 Pelle, imitating his fatherâ€™s slow tones. â€œBut I know it was the parents that drowned itâ€”and
 buried it here.â€ He was too proud of his knowledge to relinquish it without a word. The man looked
 as if he were about to strike him, and Pelle retreated a little, and then, having confidence in his
 legs, he laughed openly. But the other seemed no longer aware of his presence, and stood looking dully
 past the cairn. Pelle drew nearer again. The man started at Pelleâ€™s shadow, and heaved a deep sigh.
 â€œIs that you?â€ he said apathetically, without looking at Pelle. â€œWhy canâ€™t you leave me
 alone?â€ â€œItâ€™s _my_ field,â€ said Pelle, â€œbecause I herd here; but you may stay here if you
 wonâ€™t hit me. And you mustnâ€™t touch the cairn, because thereâ€™s a little baby buried there.â€
 The young man looked gravely at Pelle. â€œItâ€™s not true what you say! How dare you tell such a lie?
 God hates a lie. But youâ€™re a simple-hearted child, and Iâ€™ll tell you all about it without hiding
 anything, as truly as I only want to walk wholly in Godâ€™s sight.â€ Pelle looked at him uncomprehendingly.
 â€œI should think I ought to know all about it,â€ he said, â€œconsidering I know the whole song by
 heart. I can sing it to you, if you like. It goes like this.â€ Pelle began to sing in a voice that was
 a little tremulous with shynessâ€” â€œSo happy are we in our childhoodâ€™s first years, Neither
 sorrow nor sin is our mead; We play, and thereâ€™s nought in our path to raise fears That it straight
 into prison doth lead. Right many there are that with voice sorrowful Must oft for lost happiness
 long. To make the time pass in this prison so dull, I now will write down all my song. I played with my
 father, with mother I played, And childhoodâ€™s days came to an end; And when I had grown up into a young
 maid, I played still, but now with my friend. I gave him my day and I gave him my night, And never once
 thought of deceit; But when I him told of my sorrowful plight, My trust I had cause to regret. â€˜I never
 have loved you,â€™ he quickly did say; â€˜Begone! Iâ€™ll neâ€™er see you again!â€™ He turned on his
 heel and went angry away. â€™Twas then I a murdâ€™ress became.â€ Here Pelle paused in astonishment,
 for the grown-up man had sunk forward as he sat, and he was sobbing. â€œYes, it was wicked,â€ he said.
 â€œFor then she killed her child and had to go to prison.â€ He spoke with a certain amount of contempt;
 he did not like men that cried. â€œBut itâ€™s nothing that you need cry about,â€ he added carelessly,
 after a little. â€œYes, it is; for sheâ€™d done nothing. It was the childâ€™s father that killed it;
 it was me that did the dreadful thing; yes, I confess that Iâ€™m a murderer! Havenâ€™t I openly enough
 acknowledged by wrongdoing?â€ He turned his face upward, as though he were speaking to God. â€œOh,
 was it you?â€ said Pelle, moving a little away from him. â€œDid you kill your own child? Father Lasse
 could never have done that! But then why arenâ€™t you in prison? Did you tell a lie, and say _sheâ€™d_
 done it?â€ These words had a peculiar effect upon the fisherman. Pelle stood watching him for a little,
 and then exclaimed: â€œYou do talk so queerlyâ€”â€˜blop-blop-blop,â€™ just as if you were from
 another country. And what do you scrabble in the air with your fingers for, and cry? Will you get a thrashing
 when you get home?â€ At the word â€œcry,â€ the man burst into a flood of tears. Pelle had never seen
 any one cry so unrestrainedly. His face seemed all blurred. â€œWill you have a piece of my bread-and-butter?â€
 he asked, by way of offering comfort. â€œIâ€™ve got some with sausage on.â€ The fisherman shook
 his head. Pelle looked at the cairn. He was obstinate, and determined not to give in. â€œIt _is_ buried
 there,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™ve seen its soul myself, burning up on the top of the heap at night. Thatâ€™s
 because it canâ€™t get into heaven.â€ A horrible sound came from the fishermanâ€™s lips, a hollow
 groan that brought Pelleâ€™s little heart into his mouth. He began to jump up and down in fear, and
 when he recovered his senses and stopped, he saw the fisherman running with head bent low across the
 meadow, until he disappeared among the dunes. Pelle gazed after him in astonishment, and then moved
 slowly toward his dinner-basket. The result of the encounter was, as far as it had gone, a disappointment.
 He had sung to a perfect stranger, and there was no denying that that was an achievement, considering
 how difficult it often was only to answer â€œyesâ€ or â€œnoâ€ to somebody youâ€™d never seen before.
 But he had hardly more than begun the verses, and what made the performance remarkable was that he
 knew the entire ballad by heart. He sang it now for his own benefit from beginning to end, keeping count
 of the verses on his fingers; and he found the most intense satisfaction in shouting it out at the top
 of his voice. In the evening he as usual discussed the events of the day with his father, and he then
 understood one or two things that filled his mind with uncomfortable thoughts. Father Lasseâ€™s
 was as yet the only human voice that the boy wholly understood; a mere sigh or shake of the head from
 the old man had a more convincing power than words from any one else. â€œAlas!â€ he said again and
 again. â€œEvil, evil everywhere; sorrow and trouble wherever you turn! Heâ€™d willingly give his
 life to go to prison in her stead, now itâ€™s too late! So he ran away when you said that to him? Well,
 well, itâ€™s not easy to resist the Word of God even from the lips of a child, when the conscience is
 sore; and trading in the happiness of others is a bad way of earning a living. But now see about getting
 your feet washed, laddie.â€ Life furnished enough to work at and struggle with, and a good deal to
 dread; but worse almost than all that would harm Pelle himself, were the glimpses he now and then had
 of the depths of humanity: in the face of these his childâ€™s brain was powerless. Why did the mistress
 cry so much and drink secretly? What went on behind the windows in the big house? He could not comprehend
 it, and every time he puzzled his little brain over it, the uncomfortable feeling only seemed to stare
 out at him from all the window-panes, and sometimes enveloped him in all the horror of the incomprehensible.
 But the sun rode high in the heavens, and the nights were light. The darkness lay crouching under the
 earth and had no power. And he possessed the childâ€™s happy gift of forgetting instantly and completely.
 VI Pelle had a quick pulse and much energy, and there was always something that he was attempting to
 overtake in his restless onward rushâ€”if nothing else, then time itself. Now the rye was all in,
 now the last stack disappeared from the field, the shadows grew longer every day. But one evening
 the darkness surprised him before his bedtime, and this made him serious. He no longer hastened on
 the time, but tried to hold it back by many small sun-signs. One day the menâ€™s midday rest was taken
 off. They harnessed the horses again as soon as they had eaten their dinner, and the chaff-cutting
 was put off until the evening. The horse-way lay on the outer side of the stable, and none of the men
 cared to tramp round out there in the dark, driving for the chaff-cutter, so Pelle had to do it. Lasse
 protested and threatened to go to the farmer, but it was of no use; every evening Pelle had to be out
 there for a couple of hours. They were his nicest hours that they took from him, the hours when he and
 Father Lasse pottered about in the stable, and talked themselves happily through all the dayâ€™s
 troubles into a common bright future; and Pelle cried. When the moon chased the clouds away and he
 could see everything round him distinctly, he allowed his tears to run freely; but on dark evenings
 he was quiet and held his breath. Sometimes when it rained it was so dark that the farm and everything
 disappeared; and then he saw hundreds of beings that at other times the light hid. They appeared out
 of the darkness, terribly big, or came sliding up to him upon their bellies. He grew rigid as he gazed,
 and could not take his eyes from them. He sought shelter under the wall, and encouraged the horse from
 there; and one evening he ran in. They chased him out again, and he submitted to be chased, for when
 it came to the point he was more afraid of the men inside than of the beings outside. But one pitch-dark
 evening he was in an unusually bad way, and when he discovered that the horse, his only comfort, was
 also afraid, he dropped everything and ran in for the second time. Threats were powerless to make
 him go out again, and blows equally so, and one of the men took him up and carried him out; but then Pelle
 forgot everything, and screamed till the house shook. While they were struggling with him, the farmer
 came out. He was very angry when he heard what was the matter, and blew the foreman up sky high. Then
 he took Pelle by the hand, and went down with him to the cow-stable. â€œA man like you to be afraid of
 a little dark!â€ he said jokingly. â€œYou must try to get the better of that. But if the men harm you,
 just you come to me.â€ The plough went up and down the fields all day long, and made the earth dark in
 color, the foliage became variegated, and there was often sleet. The coats of the cattle grew thicker,
 their hair grew long and stood up on their backs. Pelle had much to put up with, and existence as a whole
 became a shade more serious. His clothing did not become thicker and warmer with the cold weather
 like that of the cattle; but he could crack his whip so that it sounded, in the most successful attempts,
 like little shots; he could thrash Rud when there was no unfairness, and jump across the stream at
 its narrowest part. All that brought warmth to the body. The flock now grazed all over the farm-lands,
 wherever the cows had been tethered; the dairy-cows being now indoors; or they went inland on the
 fens, where all the farms had each a piece of grass-land. Here Pelle made acquaintance with herd-boys
 from the other farms, and looked into quite another world that was not ruled by bailiff and farm-pupil
 and thrashings, but where all ate at the same table, and the mistress herself sat and spun wool for
 the herd-boysâ€™ stockings. But he could never get in there, for they did not take Swedes at the small
 farms, nor would the people of the island take service together with them. He was sorry for this. As
 soon as the autumn ploughing was started up on the fields, the boys, according to old custom, took
 down the boundary-fences and let all the animals graze together. The first few days it gave them more
 to do, for the animals fought until they got to know one another. They were never wholly mingled; they
 always grazed in patches, each farmâ€™s flock by itself. The dinner-baskets were also put together,
 and one boy was appointed in turn to mind the whole herd. The other boys played at robbers up among the
 rocks, or ran about in the woods or on the shore. When it was really cold they lighted bonfires, or built
 fireplaces of flat stones, where they roasted apples and eggs which they stole from the farms. It
 was a glorious life, and Pelle was happy. It was true he was the smallest of them all, and his being a
 Swede was a drawback to him. In the midst of their play, the others would sometimes begin to mimic his
 way of talking, and when he grew angry asked why he did not draw his knife. But on the other hand he was
 from the biggest farm, and was the only one that had bullocks in his herd; he was not behind them in physical
 accomplishments, and none of them could carve as he could. And it was his intention, when he grew big,
 to thrash them all. In the meantime he had to accommodate himself to circumstances, ingratiate himself
 with the big ones, wherever he discovered there was a flaw in their relations to one another, and be
 obliging. He had to take his turn oftener than the others, and came off badly at mealtimes. He submitted
 to it as something unavoidable, and directed all his efforts toward getting the best that it was possible
 to get out of the circumstances; but he promised himself, as has been said, the fullest reparation
 when he grew big. Once or twice it became too hot for him, and he left the community and kept by himself;
 but he soon returned to the others again. His little body was bursting with courage to live the life,
 and would not let him shirk it; he must take his chanceâ€”eat his way through. One day there came two
 new boys, who herded cattle from two farms on the other side of the stone-quarry. They were twins,
 and their names were Alfred and Albinus. They were tall, thin lads, who looked as if they might have
 been half-starved when they were little; their skin had a bluish tinge, and stood the cold badly.
 They were quick and active, they could overtake the quickest calf, they could walk on their hands
 and smoke at the same time, and not only vault but really jump obstacles. They were not much good at
 fighting; they were lacking in courage, and their ability forsook them in an emergency. There was
 something comical about the two brothers. â€œHere are the twins, the twelvins!â€ cried the whole
 flock in greeting, the first morning they appeared. â€œWell, how many times have you had a baby in
 your house since last year?â€ They belonged to a family of twelve, and among these there had twice
 been twins, and this of itself was an inexhaustible source of raillery; and moreover they were half
 Swedish. They shared the disadvantage with Pelle. But nothing seemed to have any effect upon them;
 they grinned at everything, and gave themselves away still more. From all he saw and heard, Pelle
 could understand that there was something ridiculous about their home in the eyes of the parish;
 but they did not mind that. It was the fecundity of their parents that was the special subject of derision,
 and the two boys quite happily exposed them to ridicule, and would tell all about the most private
 home matters. One day when the flock had been most persistent in calling â€œTwelvins!â€ they said,
 grinning, that their mother would soon be having a thirteenth. They were incapable of being wounded.
 Every time they exposed their parents to ridicule, it hurt Pelle, for his own feelings on this point
 were the most sacred that he had. Try as he would, he could not understand them; he had to go to his father
 with the matter one evening. â€œSo they mock and make fun of their own parents?â€ said Lasse. â€œThen
 theyâ€™ll never prosper in this world, for youâ€™re to honor your father and mother. Good parents
 who have brought them into the world with pain, and must toil hard, perhaps hunger and put up with much
 themselves, to get food and clothing for them! Oh, itâ€™s a shame! And you say their surname is Karlsson
 like ours, and that they live on the heath behind the stone-quarry? Then they must be brother Kalleâ€™s
 sons! Why, bless my soul, if I donâ€™t believe thatâ€™s it! You ask them tomorrow if their father hasnâ€™t
 a notch in his right ear! I did it myself with a piece of a horse-shoe when we were little boys one day
 I was in a rage with him because he made fun of me before the others. He was just the same as those two,
 but he didnâ€™t mean anything by it, there was nothing ill-natured about him.â€ The boysâ€™ father
 _had_ a notch in his right ear. Pelle and they were thus cousins; and the way that both they and their
 parents were made fun of was a matter for both laughter and tears. In a way, Father Lasse too came in
 for a share of the ridicule, and that thought was hardly to be endured. The other boys quickly discovered
 Pelleâ€™s vulnerable point, and used it for their own advantage; and Pelle had to give way and put
 up with things in order to keep his father out of their conversation. He did not always succeed, however.
 When they were in the mood, they said quite absurd things about one anotherâ€™s homes. They were not
 intended to be taken for more than they were worth, but Pelle did not understand jokes on that head.
 One day one of the biggest boys said to him: â€œDo you know, your father was the cause of his own motherâ€™s
 having a child!â€ Pelle did not understand the play of words in this coarse joke, but he heard the
 laughter of the others, and becoming blind with rage, he flew at the big boy, and kicked him so hard
 in the stomach, that he had to keep his bed for several days. During those days, Pelle went about in
 fear and trembling. He dared not tell his father what had happened, for then he would be obliged to
 repeat the boyâ€™s ugly accusation, too; so he went about in dread of the fatal consequences. The
 other boys had withdrawn themselves from him, so as not to share the blame if anything came of it; the
 boy was a farmerâ€™s sonâ€”the only one in the companyâ€”and they had visions of the magistrate at
 the back of the affair, and perhaps a caning at the town-hall. So Pelle went by himself with his cattle,
 and had plenty of time to think about the event, which, by the force of his lively imagination, grew
 larger and larger in its consequences, until at last it almost suffocated him with terror. Every
 cart he saw driving along the high-road sent a thrill through him; and if it turned up toward Stone
 Farm, he could distinctly see the policemenâ€”three of themâ€”with large handcuffs, just as they
 had come to fetch Erik Erikson for ill-treating his wife. He hardly dared drive the cattle home in
 the evening. One morning the boy came herding over there with his cattle, and there was a grown-up
 man with him, whom, from his clothes and everything else about him, Pelle judged to be a farmerâ€”was
 it the boyâ€™s father? They stood over there for a little while, talking to the herd-boys, and then
 came across toward him, with the whole pack at their heels, the father holding his son by the hand.
 The perspiration started from every pore of Pelleâ€™s body; his fear prompted him to run away, but
 he stood his ground. Together the father and son made a movement with their hand, and Pelle raised
 both elbows to ward off a double box-on-the-ears. But they only extended their hands. â€œI beg your
 pardon,â€ said the boy, taking one of Pelleâ€™s hands; â€œI beg your pardon,â€ repeated the father,
 clasping his other hand in his. Pelle stood in bewilderment, looking from one to the other. At first
 he thought that the man was the same as the one sent by God; but it was only his eyesâ€”those strange
 eyes. Then he suddenly burst into tears and forgot all else in the relief they brought from the terrible
 anxiety. The two spoke a few kind words to him, and quietly went away to let him be alone. After this
 Pelle and Peter Kure became friends, and when Pelle learnt to know him better, he discovered that
 sometimes the boy had a little of the same look in his eyes as his father, and the young fisherman, and
 the man that was sent by God. The remarkable course that the event had taken occupied his mind for a
 long time. One day a chance comparison of his experiences brought him to the discovery of the connection
 between this mysterious expression in their eyes and their remarkable actions; the people who had
 looked at him with those eyes had all three done unexpected things. And another day it dawned upon
 him that these people were _religious_; the boys had quarrelled with Peter Kure that day, and had
 used the word as a term of abuse against his parents. There was one thing that was apparent, and outweighed
 everything, even his victory. He had entered the lists with a boy who was bigger and stronger than
 he, and had held his own, because for the first time in his life he had struck out recklessly. If you
 wanted to fight, you had to kick wherever it hurt most. If you only did that, and had justice on your
 side, you might fight anybody, even a farmerâ€™s son. These were two satisfactory discoveries,
 which for the present nothing could disturb. Then he had defended his father; that was something
 quite new and important in his life. He required more space now. At Michaelmas, the cattle were taken
 in, and the last of the day- laborers left. During the summer, several changes had been made among
 the regular servants at the farm, but now, at term-day, none were changed; it was not the habit of Stone
 Farm to change servants at the regular term-times. So Pelle again helped his father with the foddering
 indoors. By rights he should have begun to go to school, and a mild representation of this fact was
 made to the farmer by the school authorities; but the boy was very useful at home, as the care of the
 cattle was too much for one man; and nothing more was heard about the matter. Pelle was glad it was put
 off. He had thought much about school in the course of the summer, and had invested it with so much that
 was unfamiliar and great that he was now quite afraid of it. VII Christmas Eve was a great disappointment.
 It was the custom for the herd-boys to come out and spend Christmas at the farms where they served in
 the summer, and Pelleâ€™s companions had told him of all the delights of Christmasâ€”roast meat
 and sweet drinks, Christmas games and ginger-nuts and cakes; it was one endless eating and drinking
 and playing of Christmas games, from the evening before Christmas Eve until â€œSaint Knut carried
 Christmas out,â€ on January 7th. That was what it was like at all the small farms, the only difference
 being that those who were religious did not play cards, but sang hymns instead. But what they had to
 eat was just as good. The last few days before Christmas Pelle had to get up at two or half-past two to
 help the girls pluck poultry, and the old thatcher Holm to heat the oven. With this his connection
 with the delights of Christmas came to an end. There was dried cod and boiled rice on Christmas Eve,
 and it tasted good enough; but of all the rest there was nothing. There were a couple of bottles of brandy
 on the table for the men, that was all. The men were discontented and quarrelsome. They poured milk
 and boiled rice into the leg of the stocking that Karna was knitting, so that she was fuming the whole
 evening; and then sat each with his girl on his knee, and made ill-natured remarks about everything.
 The old farm-laborers and their wives, who had been invited to partake of the Christmas fare, talked
 about death and all the ills of the world. Upstairs there was a large party. All the wifeâ€™s relations
 were invited, and they were hard at work on the roast goose. The yard was full of conveyances, and the
 only one of the farm-servants who was in good spirits was the head man, who received all the tips. Gustav
 was in a thoroughly bad humor, for Bodil was upstairs helping to wait. He had brought his concertina
 over, and was playing love-songs. It was putting them into better spirits, and the evil expression
 was leaving their eyes; one after another they started singing, and it began to be quite comfortable
 down there. But just then a message came to say that they must make less noise, so the assembly broke
 up, the old people going home, and the young ones dispersing in couples according to the friendships
 of the moment. Lasse and Pelle went to bed. â€œWhatâ€™s Christmas really for?â€ asked Pelle. Lasse
 rubbed his thigh reflectively. â€œIt has to be,â€ he answered hesitatingly. â€œYes, and then itâ€™s
 the time when the year turns round and goes upward, you see! And of course itâ€™s the night when the
 Child Jesus was born, too!â€ It took him a long time to produce this last reason, but when it did come
 it was with perfect assurance. â€œTaking one thing with another, you see,â€ he added, after a short
 pause. On the day after Christmas Day there was a kind of subscription merrymaking at an enterprising
 crofterâ€™s down in the village; it was to cost two and a half krones a couple for music, sandwiches,
 and spirits in the middle of the night, and coffee toward morning. Gustav and Bodil were going. Pelle
 at any rate saw a little of Christmas as it passed, and was as interested in it as if it concerned himself;
 and he gave Lasse no rest from his questions that day. So Bodil was still faithful to Gustav, after
 all! When they got up the next morning, they found Gustav lying on the ground by the cow-stable door,
 quite helpless, and his good clothes in a sad state. Bodil was not with him. â€œThen sheâ€™s deceived
 him,â€ said Lasse, as they helped him in. â€œPoor boy! Only seventeen, and a wounded heart already!
 The womenâ€™ll be his ruin one of these days, youâ€™ll see!â€ At midday, when the farm-laborersâ€™
 wives came to do the milking, Lasseâ€™s supposition was confirmed: Bodil had attached herself to
 a tailorâ€™s apprentice from the village, and had left with him in the middle of the night. They laughed
 pityingly at Gustav, and for some time after he had to put up with their gibes at his ill-success; but
 there was only one opinion about Bodil. She was at liberty to come and go with whomsoever she liked,
 but as long as Gustav was paying for her amusements, she ought to have kept to him. Who but the neighbor
 would keep the hens that ate their grain at home and laid their eggs at the neighborâ€™s? There had
 as yet been no opportunity to visit Lasseâ€™s brother beyond the stone-quarry, but it was to be done
 on the second day of the new year. Between Christmas and the New Year the men did nothing after dark,
 and it was the custom everywhere to help the herdsman with his evening occupations. There was nothing
 of that here; Lasse was too old to assert himself, and Pelle too little. They might think themselves
 lucky they did not have to do the foddering for the men who went out as well as their own. But to-day it
 was to come off; Gustav and Long Ole had undertaken to do the evening work. Pelle began to look forward
 to it as soon as he was upâ€”he was up every day by half-past three. But as Lasse used to say, if you sing
 before breakfast youâ€™ll weep before night. After dinner, Gustav and Ole were standing grinding
 chopping knives down in the lower yard. The trough leaked, and Pelle had to pour water on the grindstone
 out of an old kettle. His happiness could be seen on his face. â€œWhat are you so pleased about?â€
 asked Gustav. â€œYour eyes are shining like the catâ€™s in the dark.â€ Pelle told him. â€œIâ€™m
 afraid you wonâ€™t get away!â€ said Ole, winking at Gustav. â€œWe shanâ€™t get the chaff cut time
 enough to do the foddering. This grindstoneâ€™s so confoundedly hard to turn, too. If only that handle-turner
 hadnâ€™t been broken!â€ Pelle pricked up his ears. â€œHandle-turner? Whatâ€™s that?â€ he asked.
 Gustav sprang round the grindstone, and slapped his thigh in enjoyment of the joke. â€œMy goodness,
 how stupid you are! Donâ€™t you even know what a handle-turner is? Itâ€™s a thing you only need to put
 on to the grindstone, and it turns it by itself. Theyâ€™ve got one by-the-way over at Kaase Farm,â€
 he said, turning to Ole; â€œif only it wasnâ€™t so far away.â€ â€œIs it heavy?â€ asked Pelle, in
 a low voice; everything depended upon the answer. â€œCan I lift it?â€ His voice trembled. â€œOh,
 no, not so awfully heavy. You could carry it quite well. But youâ€™d have to be very careful.â€ â€œI
 can run over and fetch it; Iâ€™ll carry it very carefully.â€ Pelle looked at them with a face that
 could not but inspire confidence. â€œVery well; but take a sack with you to put it in. And youâ€™ll
 have to be as careful as the very devil, for itâ€™s an expensive thing.â€ Pelle found a sack and ran
 off across the fields. He was as delighted as a young kid, plucking at himself and everything as he
 ran, and jumping aside to frighten the crows. He was overflowing with happiness. He was saving the
 expedition for himself and Father Lasse. Gustav and Ole were good men! He would get back as quickly
 as possible, so that they should not have to toil any more at the grindstone. â€œWhat, are you back
 already?â€ they would say, and open their eyes. â€œThen you must have smashed that precious machine
 on the way!â€ And they would take it carefully out of the sack, and it would be quite safe and sound.
 â€œWell, you are a wonder of a boy! a perfect prince!â€ they would say. When he got to Kaase Farm, they
 wanted him to go in to a Christmas meal while they were putting the machine into the sack; but Pelle
 said â€œNoâ€ and held to it: he had not time. So they gave him a piece of cold apple out on the steps,
 so that he should not carry Christmas away. They all looked so pleasant, and every one came out when
 he hoisted the sack on his back and set off home. They too recommended him to be very careful, and seemed
 anxious, as if he could hardly realize what he was carrying. It was a good mile between the farms, but
 it was an hour and a half before Pelle reached home, and then he was ready to drop. He dared not put down
 the sack to rest, but stumbled on step by step, only resting once by leaning against a stone fence.
 When at last he staggered into the yard, every one came up to see the neighborâ€™s new handle-turner;
 and Pelle was conscious of his own importance when Ole carefully lifted the sack from his back. He
 leaned for a moment over toward the wall before he regained his balance; the ground was so strange
 to tread upon now he was rid of his burden; it pushed him away. But his face was radiant. Gustav opened
 the sack, which was securely closed, and shook out its contents upon the stone pavement. They were
 pieces of brick, a couple of old ploughshares, and other similar things. Pelle stared in bewilderment
 and fear at the rubbish, looking as if he had just dropped from another planet; but when laughter broke
 out on all sides, he understood what it all meant, and, crouching down, hid his face in his hands. He
 would not cryâ€”not for the world; they should not have that satisfaction. He was sobbing in his heart,
 but he kept his lips tightly closed. His body tingled with rage. The beasts! The wicked devils! Suddenly
 he kicked Gustav on the leg. â€œAha, so he kicks, does he?â€ exclaimed Gustav, lifting him up into
 the air. â€œDo you want to see a little imp from Smaaland?â€ Pelle covered his face with his arms and
 kicked to be let down; and he also made an attempt to bite. â€œEh, and he bites, too, the little devil!â€
 Gustav had to hold him firmly so as to manage him. He held him by the collar, pressing his knuckles against
 the boyâ€™s throat and making him gasp, while he spoke with derisive gentleness. â€œA clever youngster,
 this! Heâ€™s scarcely out of long clothes, and wants to fight already!â€ Gustav went on tormenting
 him; it looked as if he were making a display of his superior strength. â€œWell, now weâ€™ve seen that
 youâ€™re the strongest,â€ said the head man at last, â€œso let him go!â€ and when Gustav did not
 respond immediately, he received a blow from a clenched fist between his shoulder-blades. Then
 the boy was released, and went over to the stable to Lasse, who had seen the whole thing, but had not
 dared to approach. He could do nothing, and his presence would only have done harm. â€œYes, and then
 thereâ€™s our outing, laddie,â€ he explained, by way of excuse, while he was comforting the boy.
 â€œI could very well thrash a puppy like Gustav, but if I did we shouldnâ€™t get away this evening,
 for he wouldnâ€™t do our work. And none of the others, either, for they all stick together like burrs.
 But you can do it yourself! I verily believe youâ€™d kick the devil himself, right on his club-foot!
 Well, well, it was well done; but you must be careful not to waste your powder and shot. It doesnâ€™t
 pay!â€ The boy was not so easily comforted now. Deep down in his heart the remembrance of his injury
 lay and pained him, because he had acted in such good faith, and they had wounded him in his ready, cheerful
 confidence. What had happened had also stung his pride; he had walked into a trap, made a fool of himself
 for them. The incident burnt into his soul, and greatly influenced his subsequent development.
 He had already found out that a personâ€™s word was not always to be relied upon, and he had made awkward
 attempts to get behind it. Now he would trust nobody straight away any more; and he had discovered
 how the secret was to be found out. You only had to look at peopleâ€™s eyes when they said anything.
 Both here and at Kaase Farm the people had looked so strange about the handle-turner, as if they were
 laughing inside. And the bailiff had laughed that time when he promised them roast pork and stewed
 rhubarb every day. They hardly ever got anything but herring and porridge. People talked with two
 tongues; Father Lasse was the only one who did not do it. Pelle began to be observant of his own face.
 It was the face that spoke, and that was why it went badly with him when he tried to escape a thrashing
 by telling a white lie. And to-dayâ€™s misfortune had been the fault of his face; if you felt happy,
 you mustnâ€™t show it. He had discovered the danger of letting his mind lie open, and his small organism
 set to work diligently to grow hard skin to draw over its vital parts. After supper they set off across
 the fields, hand in hand as usual. As a rule, Pelle chattered unceasingly when they were by themselves;
 but this evening he was quieter. The event of the afternoon was still in his mind, and the coming visit
 gave him a feeling of solemnity. Lasse carried a red bundle in his hand, in which was a bottle of black-currant
 rum, which they had got Per Olsen to buy in the town the day before, when he had been in to swear himself
 free. It had cost sixty-six Ã¶res, and Pelle was turning something over in his mind, but did not know
 whether it would do. â€œFather!â€ he said at last. â€œMaynâ€™t I carry that a little way?â€ â€œGracious!
 Are you crazy, boy? Itâ€™s an expensive article! And you might drop it.â€ â€œI wouldnâ€™t drop it.
 Well, only hold it for a little then? Maynâ€™t I, father? Oh do, father!â€ â€œEh, what an idea! I donâ€™t
 know what youâ€™ll be like soon, if you arenâ€™t stopped! Upon my word, I think you must be ill, youâ€™re
 getting so tiresome!â€ And Lasse went on crossly for a little while, but then stopped and bent down
 over the boy. â€œHold it then, you little silly, but be very careful! And you mustnâ€™t move a single
 step while youâ€™ve got it, mind!â€ Pelle clasped the bottle to his body with his arms, for he dared
 not trust his hands, and pushed out his stomach as far as possible to support it. Lasse stood with his
 hands extended beneath the bottle, ready to catch it if it fell. â€œThere! Thatâ€™ll do!â€ he said
 anxiously, and took the bottle. â€œIt _is_ heavy!â€ said Pelle, admiringly, and went on contentedly,
 holding his fatherâ€™s hand. â€œBut why had he to swear himself free?â€ he suddenly asked. â€œBecause
 he was accused by a girl of being the father of her child. Havenâ€™t you heard about it?â€ Pelle nodded.
 â€œIsnâ€™t he, then? Everybody says he is.â€ â€œI can hardly believe it; it would be certain damnation
 for Per Olsen. But, of course, the girl says itâ€™s him and no one else. Ah me! Girls are dangerous playthings!
 You must take care when your time comes, for they can bring misfortune upon the best of men.â€ â€œHow
 do you swear, then? Do you say â€˜Devil take meâ€™?â€ Lasse could not help laughing. â€œNo, indeed!
 That wouldnâ€™t be very good for those that swear false. No, you see, in the court all Godâ€™s highest
 ministers are sitting round a table thatâ€™s exactly like a horseshoe, and beyond that again thereâ€™s
 an altar with the crucified Christ Himself upon it. On the altar lies a big, big book thatâ€™s fastened
 to the wall with an iron chain, so that the devil canâ€™t carry it off in the night, and thatâ€™s Godâ€™s
 Holy Word. When a man swears, he lays his left hand upon the book, and holds up his right hand with three
 fingers in the air; theyâ€™re God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. But if he swears false, the Governor
 can see it at once, because then there are red spots of blood on the leaves of the book.â€ â€œAnd what
 then?â€ asked Pelle, with deep interest. â€œWell, then his three fingers wither, and it goes on
 eating itself into his body. People like that suffer frightfully; they rot right away.â€ â€œDonâ€™t
 they go to hell, then?â€ â€œYes, they do that too, except when they give themselves up and take their
 punishment, and then they escape in the next life; but they canâ€™t escape withering away.â€ â€œWhy
 doesnâ€™t the Governor take them himself and punish them, when he can see in that book that they swore
 false?â€ â€œWhy, because then theyâ€™d get off going to hell, and thereâ€™s an agreement with Satan
 that heâ€™s to have all those that donâ€™t give themselves up, donâ€™t you see?â€ Pelle shuddered,
 and for a little while walked on in silence beside his father; but when he next spoke, he had forgotten
 all about it. â€œI suppose Uncle Kalleâ€™s rich, isnâ€™t he?â€ he asked. â€œHe canâ€™t be rich,
 but heâ€™s a land-owner, and thatâ€™s not a little thing!â€ Lasse himself had never attained to
 more than renting land. â€œWhen I grow up, I mean to have a great big farm,â€ said Pelle, with decision.
 â€œYes, Iâ€™ve no doubt you will,â€ said Lasse, laughing. Not that he also did not expect something
 great of the boy, if not exactly a large farmer. There was no saying, however. Perhaps some farmerâ€™s
 daughter might fall in love with him; the men of his family generally had an attraction for women.
 Several of them had given proof of itâ€”his brother, for instance, who had taken the fancy of a parsonâ€™s
 wife. Then Pelle would have to make the most of his opportunity so that the family would be ashamed
 to oppose the match. And Pelle was good enough. He had that â€œcowâ€™s-lickâ€ on his forehead, fine
 hair at the back of his neck, and a birth-mark on his hip; and that all betokened luck. Lasse went on
 talking to himself as he walked, calculating the boyâ€™s future with large, round figures, that
 yielded a little for him too; for, however great his future might be, it would surely come in time to
 allow of Lasseâ€™s sharing and enjoying it in his very old age. They went across country toward the
 stone-quarry, following stone dikes and snow-filled ditches, and working their way through the
 thicket of blackthorn and juniper, behind which lay the rocks and â€œthe Heath.â€ They made their
 way right into the quarry, and tried in the darkness to find the place where the dross was thrown, for
 that would be where the stone-breaking went on. A sound of hammering came from the upper end of the
 ground, and they discovered lights in several places. Beneath a sloping straw screen, from which
 hung a lantern, sat a little, broad man, hammering away at the fragments. He worked with peculiar
 vivacityâ€”struck three blows and pushed the stones to one side, another three blows, and again
 to one side; and while with one hand he pushed the pieces away, with the other he placed a fresh fragment
 in position on the stone. It went as busily and evenly as the ticking of a watch. â€œWhy, if that isnâ€™t
 Brother Kalle sitting there!â€ said Lasse, in a voice of surprise as great as if the meeting were
 a miracle from heaven. â€œGood evening, Kalle Karlsson! How are you?â€ The stone-breaker looked
 up. â€œOh, there you are, brother!â€ he said, rising with difficulty; and the two greeted one another
 as if they had met only the day before. Kalle collected his tools and laid the screen down upon them
 while they talked. â€œSo you break stones too? Does that bring in anything?â€ asked Lasse. â€œOh,
 not very much. We get twelve krones a â€˜fathomâ€™ and when I work with a lantern morning and evening,
 I can break half a fathom in a week. It doesnâ€™t pay for beer, but we live anyhow. But itâ€™s awfully
 cold work; you canâ€™t keep warm at it, and you get so stiff with sitting fifteen hours on the cold stoneâ€”as
 stiff as if you were the father of the whole world.â€ He was walking stiffly in front of the others
 across the heath toward a low, hump-backed cottage. â€œAh, there comes the moon, now thereâ€™s no
 use for it!â€ said Kalle, whose spirits were beginning to rise. â€œAnd, my word, what a sight the
 old dormouse looks! He must have been at a New Yearâ€™s feast in heaven.â€ â€œYouâ€™re the same merry
 devil that you were in the old days,â€ said Lasse. â€œWell, good spiritsâ€™ll soon be the only thing
 to be had without paying for.â€ The wall of the house stuck out in a large round lump on one side, and
 Pelle had to go up to it to feel it all over. It was most mysterious what there might be on the other sideâ€”perhaps
 a secret chamber? He pulled his fatherâ€™s hand inquiringly. â€œThat? Thatâ€™s the oven where they
 bake their bread,â€ said Lasse. â€œItâ€™s put there to make more room.â€ After inviting them to
 enter, Kalle put his head in at a door that led from the kitchen to the cowshed. â€œHi, Maria! You must
 put your best foot foremost!â€ he called in a low voice. â€œThe midwifeâ€™s here!â€ â€œWhat in
 the world does she want? Itâ€™s a story, you old fool!â€ And the sound of milk squirting into the pail
 began again. â€œA story, is it? No, but you must come in and go to bed; she says itâ€™s high time you did.
 You are keeping up much too long this year. Mind what you say,â€ he whispered into the cowshed, â€œfor
 she is really here! And be quick!â€ They went into the room, and Kalle went groping about to light
 a candle. Twice he took up the matches and dropped them again to light it at the fire, but the peat was
 burning badly. â€œOh, bother!â€ he said, resolutely striking a match at last. â€œWe donâ€™t have
 visitors every day.â€ â€œYour wifeâ€™s Danish,â€ said Lasse, admiringly. â€œAnd youâ€™ve got
 a cow too?â€ â€œYes, itâ€™s a biggish place here,â€ said Kalle, drawing himself up. â€œThereâ€™s
 a cat belonging to the establishment too, and as many rats as it cares to eat.â€ His wife now appeared,
 breathless, and looking in astonishment at the visitors. â€œYes, the midwifeâ€™s gone again,â€
 said Kalle. â€œShe hadnâ€™t time to-day; we must put it off till another time. But these are important
 strangers, so you must blow your nose with your fingers before you give them your hand!â€ â€œOh,
 you old humbug! You canâ€™t take me in. Itâ€™s Lasse, of course, and Pelle!â€ And she held out her
 hand. She was short, like her husband, was always smiling, and had bowed arms and legs just as he had.
 Hard work and their cheerful temperament gave them both a rotund appearance. â€œThere are no end
 of children here,â€ said Lasse, looking about him. There were three in the turn-up bedstead under
 the windowâ€”two small ones at one end, and a long, twelve-year-old boy at the other, his black feet
 sticking out between the little girlsâ€™ heads; and other beds were made up on chairs, in an old kneading-trough,
 and on the floor. â€œYe-es; weâ€™ve managed to scrape together a few,â€ said Kalle, running about
 in vain to get something for his visitors to sit upon; everything was being used as beds. â€œYouâ€™ll
 have to spit on the floor and sit down on that,â€ he said, laughing. His wife came in, however, with
 a washing-bench and an empty beer-barrel. â€œSit you down and rest,â€ she said, placing the seats
 round the table. â€œAnd you must really excuse it, but the children must be somewhere.â€ Kalle squeezed
 himself in and sat down upon the edge of the turn-up bedstead. â€œYes, weâ€™ve managed to scrape together
 a few,â€ he repeated. â€œYou must provide for your old age while you have the strength. Weâ€™ve made
 up the dozen, and started on the next. It wasnâ€™t exactly our intention, but motherâ€™s gone and
 taken us in.â€ He scratched the back of his head, and looked the picture of despair. His wife was standing
 in the middle of the room. â€œLetâ€™s hope it wonâ€™t be twins this time too,â€ she said, laughing.
 â€œWhy, that would be a great saving, as we shall have to send for the midwife anyhow. People say of
 mother,â€ he went on, â€œthat when sheâ€™s put the children to bed she has to count them to make sure
 theyâ€™re all there; but thatâ€™s not true, because she canâ€™t count farther than ten.â€ Here
 a baby in the alcove began to cry, and the mother took it up and seated herself on the edge of the turn-up
 bedstead to nurse it. â€œAnd this is the smallest,â€ he said, holding it out toward Lasse, who put
 a crooked finger down its neck. â€œWhat a little fatty!â€ he said softly; he was fond of children.
 â€œAnd whatâ€™s its name?â€ â€œSheâ€™s called Dozena Endina, because when she came we thought
 that was to be the last; and she was the twelfth too.â€ â€œDozena Endina! Thatâ€™s a mighty fine name!â€
 exclaimed Lasse. â€œIt sounds exactly as if she might be a princess.â€ â€œYes, and the one beforeâ€™s
 called Ellenâ€”from eleven, of course. Thatâ€™s her in the kneading-trough,â€ said Kalle. â€œThe
 one before that again is Tentius, and then Nina, and Otto. The ones before that werenâ€™t named in
 that way, for we hadnâ€™t thought then that thereâ€™d be so many. But thatâ€™s all motherâ€™s fault;
 if she only puts a patch on my working-trousers, things go wrong at once.â€ â€œYou ought to be ashamed
 of yourself, trying to get out of it like that,â€ said his wife, shaking her finger at him. â€œBut
 as for that,â€ she went on, turning to Lasse, â€œIâ€™m sure the others have nothing to complain of
 either, as far as their names are concerned. Albert, Anna, Alfred, Albinus, Anton, Alma and Alvildaâ€”let
 me see, yes, thatâ€™s the lot. None of them can say theyâ€™ve not been treated fairly. Father was all
 for A at that time; they were all to rhyme with A. Poetryâ€™s always come so easy to him.â€ She looked
 admiringly at her husband. Kalle blinked his eyes in bashfulness. â€œNo, but itâ€™s the first letter,
 you see, and it sounds pretty,â€ he said modestly. â€œIsnâ€™t he clever to think of a thing like that?
 He ought to have been a student. Now _my_ head would never have been any good for anything of that sort.
 He wanted, indeed, to have the names both begin and end with A, but that wouldnâ€™t do with the boys,
 so he had to give that up. But then he hasnâ€™t had any book-learning either.â€ â€œOh, thatâ€™s too
 bad, mother! I didnâ€™t give it up. Iâ€™d made up a name for the first boy that had A at the end too; but
 then the priest and the clerk objected, and I had to let it go. They objected to Dozena Endina too, but
 I put my foot down; for I can be angry if Iâ€™m irritated too long. Iâ€™ve always liked to have some connection
 and meaning in everything; and itâ€™s not a bad idea to have something that those who look deeper can
 find out. Now, have you noticed anything special about two of these names?â€ â€œNo,â€ answered
 Lasse hesitatingly, â€œI donâ€™t know that I have. But I havenâ€™t got a head for that sort of thing
 either.â€ â€œWell, look here! Anna and Otto are exactly the same, whether you read them forward
 or backwardâ€”exactly the same. Iâ€™ll just show you.â€ He took down a childâ€™s slate that was
 hanging on the wall with a stump of slate-pencil, and began laboriously to write the names. â€œNow,
 look at this, brother!â€ â€œI canâ€™t read,â€ said Lasse, shaking his head hopelessly. â€œDoes
 it really give the same both ways? The deuce! That _is_ remarkable!â€ He could not get over his astonishment.
 â€œBut now comes something thatâ€™s still more remarkable,â€ said Kalle, looking over the top
 of the slate at his brother with the gaze of a thinker surveying the universe. â€œOtto, which can be
 read from both ends, means, of course, eight; but if I draw the figure 8, it can be turned upside down,
 and still be the same. Look here!â€ He wrote the figure eight. Lasse turned the slate up and down,
 and peered at it. â€œYes, upon my word, it is the same! Just look here, Pelle! Itâ€™s like the cat that
 always comes down upon its feet, no matter how you drop it. Lord bless my soul! how nice it must be to
 be able to spell! How did you learn it, brother?â€ â€œOh,â€ said Kalle, in a tone of superiority.
 â€œIâ€™ve sat and looked on a little when motherâ€™s been teaching the children their ABC. Itâ€™s
 nothing at all if your upper storyâ€™s all right.â€ â€œPelleâ€™ll be going to school soon,â€ said
 Lasse reflectively. â€œAnd then perhaps _I_ couldâ€”for it would be nice. But I donâ€™t suppose
 Iâ€™ve got the head for it, do you? No, Iâ€™m sure I havenâ€™t got the head for it,â€ he repeated in
 quite a despairing tone. Kalle did not seem inclined to contradict him, but Pelle made up his mind
 that some day he would teach his father to read and writeâ€”much better than Uncle Kalle could. â€œBut
 weâ€™re quite forgetting that we brought a Christmas bottle with us!â€ said Lasse, untying the
 handkerchief. â€œYou _are_ a fellow!â€ exclaimed Kalle, walking delightedly round the table
 on which the bottle stood. â€œYou couldnâ€™t have given us anything better, brother; itâ€™ll come
 in handy for the christening-party. â€˜Black Currant Rumâ€™â€”and with a gold borderâ€”how grand!â€
 He held the label up toward the light, and looked round with pleasure in his eyes. Then he hesitatingly
 opened the cupboard in the wall. â€œThe visitors ought to taste what they brought,â€ said his wife.
 â€œThatâ€™s just what was bothering me!â€ said Kalle, turning round with a disconsolate laugh.
 â€œFor they ought, of course. But if the corkâ€™s once drawn, you know how it disappears.â€ He reached
 out slowly for the corkscrew which hung on a nail. But Lasse would not hear of it; he would not taste
 the beverage for the world. Was black-currant rum a thing for a poor beggar like him to begin drinkingâ€”and
 on a weekday, too? No, indeed! â€œYes, and youâ€™ll be coming to the christening-party, you two,
 of course,â€ said Kalle, relieved, putting the bottle into the cupboard. â€œBut weâ€™ll have a
 â€˜cuckoo,â€™ for thereâ€™s a drop of spirits left from Christmas Eve, and I expect motherâ€™ll
 give us coffee.â€ â€œIâ€™ve got the coffee on,â€ answered his wife cheerfully. â€œDid you ever
 know such a wife! You can never wish for anything but what itâ€™s there already!â€ Pelle wondered
 where his two herding-comrades, Alfred and Albinus, were. They were away at their summer places,
 taking their share of the good Christmas fare, and would not be back before â€œKnut.â€ â€œBut this
 fellow hereâ€™s not to be despised,â€ said Kalle, pointing to the long boy in the turn-up bed. â€œShall
 we have a look at him?â€ And, pulling out a straw, he tickled the boyâ€™s nose with it. â€œGet up, my
 good Anton, and harness the horses to the wheelbarrow! Weâ€™re going to drive out in state.â€ The
 boy sat up and began to rub his eyes, to Kalleâ€™s great delight. At last he discovered that there were
 strangers present, and drew on his clothes, which had been doing duty as his pillow. Pelle and he became
 good friends at once, and began to play; and then Kalle hit upon the idea of letting the other children
 share in the merry-making, and he and the two boys went round and tickled them awake, all the six. His
 wife protested, but only faintly; she was laughing all the time, and herself helped them to dress,
 while she kept on saying: â€œOh, what foolishness! Upon my word, I never knew the like of it! Then this
 one shanâ€™t be left out either!â€ she added suddenly, drawing the youngest out of the alcove. â€œThen
 thatâ€™s the eight,â€ said Kalle, pointing to the flock. â€œThey fill the room well, donâ€™t they?
 Alma and Alvilda are twins, as you can see. And so are Alfred and Albinus, who are away now for Christmas.
 Theyâ€™re going to be confirmed next summer, so theyâ€™ll be off my hands.â€ â€œThen where are the
 two eldest?â€ asked Lasse. â€œAnnaâ€™s in service in the north, and Albertâ€™s at sea, out with
 a whaler just now. Heâ€™s a fine fellow. He sent us his portrait in the autumn. Wonâ€™t you show it us,
 Maria?â€ His wife began slowly to look for it, but could not find it. â€œI think I know where it is,
 mother,â€ said one of the little girls over and over again; but as no one heard what she said, she climbed
 up on to the bench, and took down an old Bible from the shelf. The photograph was in it. â€œHe is a fine
 fellow, and no mistake!â€ said Lasse. â€œThereâ€™s a pair of shoulders! Heâ€™s not like our family;
 it must be from yours, Maria, that heâ€™s got that carriage.â€ â€œHeâ€™s a Kongstrup,â€ said Kalle,
 in a low tone. â€œOh, indeed, is he?â€ said Lasse hesitatingly, recollecting Johanna Pihlâ€™s
 story. â€œMaria was housemaid at the farm, and he talked her over as he has done with so many. It was
 before my time, and he did what he ought.â€ Maria was standing looking from one to the other of them
 with a meaningless smile, but her forehead was flushed. â€œThereâ€™s gentle blood in that boy,â€
 said Kalle admiringly. â€œHe holds his head differently from the others. And heâ€™s goodâ€”so tremendously
 good.â€ Maria came slowly up to him, leaned her arm upon his shoulder, and looked at the picture with
 him. â€œHe is good, isnâ€™t he, mother?â€ said Kalle, stroking her face. â€œAnd so well-dressed
 he is too!â€ exclaimed Lasse. â€œYes, he takes care of his money. Heâ€™s not dissipated, like his
 father; and heâ€™s not afraid of parting with a ten-krone note when heâ€™s at home here on a visit.â€
 There was a rustling at the inner door, and a little, wrinkled old woman crept out onto the threshold,
 feeling her way with her feet, and holding her hands before her face to protect it. â€œIs any one dead?â€
 she asked as she faced the room. â€œWhy, thereâ€™s grandmother!â€ said Kalle. â€œI thought youâ€™d
 be in your bed.â€ â€œAnd so I was, but then I heard there were strangers here, and one likes to hear
 the news. Have there been any deaths in the parish?â€ â€œNo, grandmother, there havenâ€™t. People
 have something better to do than to die. Hereâ€™s some one come to court you, and thatâ€™s much better.
 This is mother-in-law,â€ he said, turning to the others; â€œso you can guess what sheâ€™s like.â€
 â€œJust you come here, and Iâ€™ll mother-in-law you!â€ said the old lady, with a feeble attempt
 to enter into the gaiety. â€œWell, welcome to this house then,â€ she said, extending her hand. Kalle
 stretched his out first, but as soon as she touched it, she pushed it aside, saying: â€œDo you think
 I donâ€™t know you, you fool?â€ She felt Lasseâ€™s and Pelleâ€™s hands for a long time with her soft
 fingers before she let them go. â€œNo, I donâ€™t know you!â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s Brother Lasse and
 his son down from Stone Farm,â€ Kalle informed her at last. â€œAye, is it really? Well, I never! And
 youâ€™ve come over the sea too! Well, here am I, an old body, going about here quite alone; and Iâ€™ve
 lost my sight too.â€ â€œBut youâ€™re not _quite_ alone, grandmother,â€ said Kalle, laughing.
 â€œThere are two grown-ups and half a score of children about you all day long.â€ â€œAh yes, you can
 say what you like, but all those I was young with are dead now, and many others that Iâ€™ve seen grow
 up. Every week some one that I know dies, and here am I still living, only to be a burden to others.â€
 Kalle brought in the old ladyâ€™s arm-chair from her room, and made her sit down. â€œWhatâ€™s all
 that nonsense about?â€ he said reproachfully. â€œWhy, you pay for yourself!â€ â€œPay! Oh dear!
 They get twenty krones a year for keeping me,â€ said the old woman to the company in general. The coffee
 came in, and Kalle poured brandy into the cups of all the elder people. â€œNow, grandmother, you must
 cheer up!â€ he said, touching her cup with his. â€œWhere the pot boils for twelve, it boils for the
 thirteenth as well. Your health, grandmother, and may you still live many years to be a burden to us,
 as you call it!â€ â€œYes, I know it so well, I know it so well,â€ said the old woman, rocking backward
 and forward. â€œYou mean so well by it all. But with so little wish to live, itâ€™s hard that I should
 take the food out of the othersâ€™ mouths. The cow eats, and the cat eats, the children eat, we all eat;
 and where are you, poor things, to get it all from!â€ â€œSay â€˜poor thingâ€™ to him who has no head,
 and pity him who has two,â€ said Kalle gaily. â€œHow much land have you?â€ asked Lasse. â€œFive
 acres; but itâ€™s most of it rock.â€ â€œCan you manage to feed the cow on it then?â€ â€œLast year
 it was pretty bad. We had to pull the roof off the outhouse, and use it for fodder last winter; and itâ€™s
 thrown us back a little. But dear me, it made the loft all the higher.â€ Kalle laughed. â€œAnd now
 thereâ€™ll always be more and more of the children getting able to keep themselves.â€ â€œDonâ€™t
 those who are grown up give a hand too?â€ asked Lasse. â€œHow can they? When youâ€™re young, you can
 use what youâ€™ve got yourself. They must take their pleasures while thereâ€™s time; they hadnâ€™t
 many while they were children, and once theyâ€™re married and settled theyâ€™ll have something
 else to think about. Albert is good enough when heâ€™s at home on a visit; last time he gave us ten krones
 and a krone to each of the children. But when theyâ€™re out, you know how the money goes if they donâ€™t
 want to look mean beside their companions. Annaâ€™s one of those who can spend all they get on clothes.
 Sheâ€™s willing enough to do without, but she never has a farthing, and hardly a rag to her body, for
 all that sheâ€™s for ever buying.â€ â€œNo, sheâ€™s the strangest creature,â€ said her mother.
 â€œShe never can make anything do.â€ The turn-up bedstead was shut to give room to sit round the table,
 and an old pack of cards was produced. Every one was to play except the two smallest, who were really
 too little to grasp a card; Kalle wanted, indeed, to have them too, but it could not be managed. They
 played beggar-my-neighbor and Black Peter. Grandmotherâ€™s cards had to be read out to her. The
 conversation still went on among the elder people. â€œHow do you like working for the farmer at Stone
 Farm?â€ asked Kalle. â€œWe donâ€™t see much of the farmer himself; heâ€™s pretty nearly always
 out, or sleeping after a night on the loose. But heâ€™s nice enough in other ways; and itâ€™s a house
 where they feed you properly.â€ â€œWell, there are places where the foodâ€™s worse,â€ said Kalle,
 â€œbut there canâ€™t be many. Most of them, certainly, are better.â€ â€œAre they really?â€ asked
 Lasse, in surprise. â€œWell, I donâ€™t complain as far as the foodâ€™s concerned; but thereâ€™s
 a little too much for us two to do, and then itâ€™s so miserable to hear that woman crying nearly the
 whole time. I wonder if he ill-treats her; they say not.â€ â€œIâ€™m sure he doesnâ€™t,â€ said Kalle.
 â€œEven if he wanted toâ€”as you can very well understand he mightâ€”he dursnâ€™t. Heâ€™s afraid
 of her, for sheâ€™s possessed by a devil, you know.â€ â€œThey say sheâ€™s a were-wolf at night,â€
 said Lasse, looking as if he expected to see a ghost in one of the corners. â€œSheâ€™s a poor body, who
 has her own troubles,â€ said Maria, â€œand every woman knows a little what that means. And the farmerâ€™s
 not all kindness either, even if he doesnâ€™t beat her. She feels his unfaithfulness more than sheâ€™d
 feel anything else.â€ â€œOh, you wives always take one anotherâ€™s part,â€ said Kalle, â€œbut
 other people have eyes too. What do _you_ say, grandmother? You know that better than any one else.â€
 â€œWell, I know something about it at any rate,â€ said the old woman. â€œI remember the time when
 Kongstrup came to the island as well as if it had been yesterday. He owned nothing more than the clothes
 he wore, but he was a fine gentleman for all that, and lived in Copenhagen.â€ â€œWhat did he want over
 here?â€ asked Lasse. â€œWhat did he want? To look for a young girl with money, I suppose. He wandered
 about on the heath here with his gun, but it wasnâ€™t foxes he was after. She was fooling about on the
 heath too, admiring the wild scenery, and nonsense like that, and behaving half like a man, instead
 of being kept at home and taught to spin and make porridge; but she was the only daughter, and was allowed
 to go on just as she liked. And then she meets this spark from the town, and they become friends. He was
 a curate or a pope, or something of the sort, so you canâ€™t wonder that the silly girl didnâ€™t know
 what she was doing.â€ â€œNo, indeed!â€ said Lasse. â€œThereâ€™s always been something all wrong
 with the women of that family,â€ the old woman continued. â€œThey say one of them once gave herself
 to Satan, and since then heâ€™s had a claim upon them and ill-treats them whenever the moonâ€™s waning,
 whether they like it or not. He has no power over the pure, of course; but when these two had got to know
 one another, things went wrong with her too. He must have noticed it, and tried to get off, for they
 said that the old farmer of Stone Farm compelled him with his gun to take her for his wife; and he was
 a hard old dog, whoâ€™d have shot a man down as soon as look at him. But he was a peasant through and through,
 who wore home-woven clothes, and wasnâ€™t afraid of working from sunrise to sunset. It wasnâ€™t
 like what it is now, with debts and drinking and card-playing, so people had something then.â€ â€œWell,
 now theyâ€™d like to thresh the corn while itâ€™s still standing, and they sell the calves before
 theyâ€™re born,â€ said Kalle. â€œBut I say, grandmother, youâ€™re Black Peter!â€ â€œThat comes
 of letting oneâ€™s tongue run on and forgetting to look after oneâ€™s self!â€ said the old lady.
 â€œGrandmotherâ€™s got to have her face blacked!â€ cried the children. She begged to be let off,
 as she was just washed for the night; but the children blacked a cork in the stove and surrounded her,
 and she was given a black streak down her nose. Every one laughed, both old and young, and grandmother
 laughed with them, saying it was a good thing she could not see it herself. â€œItâ€™s an ill wind,â€
 she said, â€œthat blows nobody any good. But I should like to have my sight again,â€ she went on, â€œif
 itâ€™s only for five minutes, before I die. It would be nice to see it all once more, now that the trees
 and everything have grown so, as Kalle says they have. The whole country must have changed. And Iâ€™ve
 never seen the youngest children at all.â€ â€œThey say that they can take blindness away over in
 Copenhagen,â€ said Kalle to his brother. â€œIt would cost a lot of money, wouldnâ€™t it?â€ asked
 Lasse. â€œIt would cost a hundred krones at the very least,â€ the grandmother remarked. Kalle looked
 thoughtful. â€œIf we were to sell the whole blooming thing, it would be funny if there wasnâ€™t a hundred
 krones over. And then grandmother could have her sight again.â€ â€œGoodness gracious me!â€ exclaimed
 the old woman. â€œSell your house and home! You must be out of your mind! Throw away a large capital
 upon an old, worn-out thing like me, that has one foot in the grave! I couldnâ€™t wish for anything
 better than what I have!â€ She had tears in her eyes. â€œPray God I maynâ€™t bring about such a misfortune
 in my old age!â€ â€œOh, rubbish! Weâ€™re still young,â€ said Kalle. â€œWe could very well begin
 something new, Maria and me.â€ â€œHave none of you heard how Jacob Kristianâ€™s widow is?â€ asked
 the old lady by way of changing the subject. â€œIâ€™ve got it into my head that sheâ€™ll go first, and
 then me. I heard the crow calling over there last night.â€ â€œThatâ€™s our nearest neighbor on the
 heath,â€ explained Kalle. â€œIs she failing now? Thereâ€™s been nothing the matter with her this
 winter that I know of.â€ â€œWell, you may be sure thereâ€™s something,â€ said the old woman positively.
 â€œLet one of the children run over there in the morning.â€ â€œYes, if youâ€™ve had warning. Jacob
 Kristian gave good enough warning himself when he went and died. But we were good friends for many
 years, he and me.â€ â€œDid he show himself?â€ asked Lasse solemnly. â€œNo; but one nightâ€”nasty
 October weather it wasâ€”I was woke by a knocking at the outside door. Thatâ€™s a good three years
 ago. Maria heard it too, and we lay and talked about whether I should get up. We got no further than talking,
 and we were just dropping off again, when the knocking began again. I jumped up, put on a pair of trousers,
 and opened the door a crack, but there was no one there. â€˜Thatâ€™s strange!â€™ I said to Maria, and
 got into bed again; but Iâ€™d scarcely got the clothes over me, when there was a knocking for the third
 time. â€œI was cross then, and lighted the lantern and went round the house; but there was nothing
 either to be seen or heard. But in the morning there came word to say that Jacob Kristian had died in
 the night just at that time.â€ Pelle, who had sat and listened to the conversation, pressed close
 up to his father in fear; but Lasse himself did not look particularly valiant. â€œItâ€™s not always
 nice to have anything to do with the dead,â€ he said. â€œOh, nonsense! If youâ€™ve done no harm to
 any one, and given everybody their due, what can they do to you?â€ said Kalle. The grandmother said
 nothing, but sat shaking her head very significantly. Maria now placed upon the table a jar of dripping
 and a large loaf of rye-bread. â€œThatâ€™s the goose,â€ said Kalle, merrily sticking his sheath-knife
 into the loaf. â€œWe havenâ€™t begun it yet. There are prunes inside. And thatâ€™s goose-fat. Help
 yourselves!â€ After that Lasse and Pelle had to think about getting home, and began to tie handkerchiefs
 round their necks; but the others did not want to let them go yet. They went on talking, and Kalle made
 jokes to keep them a little longer. But suddenly he turned as grave as a judge; there was a low sound
 of crying out in the little passage, and some one took hold of the handle of the door and let go of it again.
 â€œUpon my word, itâ€™s ghosts!â€ he exclaimed, looking fearfully from one to another. The sound
 of crying was heard again, and Maria, clasping her hands together, exclaimed: â€œWhy, itâ€™s Anna!â€
 and quickly opened the door. Anna entered in tears, and was attacked on all sides with surprised inquiries,
 to which her sobs were her only answer. â€œAnd youâ€™ve been given a holiday to come and see us at Christmas
 time, and you come home crying! You are a nice one!â€ said Kalle, laughing. â€œYou must give her something
 to suck, mother!â€ â€œIâ€™ve lost my place,â€ the girl at last got out between her sobs. â€œNo,
 surely not!â€ exclaimed Kalle, in changed tones. â€œBut what for? Have you been stealing? Or been
 impudent?â€ â€œNo, but the master accused me of being too thick with his son.â€ In a flash the motherâ€™s
 eyes darted from the girlâ€™s face to her figure, and she too burst into tears. Kalle could see nothing,
 but he caught his wifeâ€™s action and understood. â€œOh!â€ he said quietly. â€œIs that it?â€ The
 little man was like a big child in the way the different expressions came and went upon his good-natured
 face. At last the smile triumphed again. â€œWell, well, thatâ€™s capital!â€ he exclaimed, laughing.
 â€œShouldnâ€™t good children take the work off their parentsâ€™ shoulders as they grow up and are
 able to do it? Take off your things, Anna, and sit down. I expect youâ€™re hungry, arenâ€™t you? And
 it couldnâ€™t have happened at a better time, as weâ€™ve got to have the midwife anyhow!â€ Lasse
 and Pelle drew their neckerchiefs up over their mouths after taking leave of every one in the room,
 Kalle circling round them restlessly, and talking eagerly. â€œCome again soon, you two, and thanks
 for this visit and your present, Brother Lasse! Oh, yes!â€ he said suddenly at the outside door,
 and laughed delightedly; â€œitâ€™ll be something grandâ€”brother-in-law to the farmer in a way!
 Oh, fie, Kalle Karlsson! You and Iâ€™ll be giving ourselves airs now!â€ He went a little way along
 the path with them, talking all the time. Lasse was quite melancholy over it. Pelle knew quite well
 that what had happened to Anna was looked upon as a great disgrace, and could not understand how Uncle
 Kalle could seem so happy. â€œAh, yes,â€ said Lasse, as they stumbled along among the stones. â€œKalleâ€™s
 just like what he always was! He laughs where others would cry.â€ It was too dark to go across the fields,
 so they took the quarry road south to get down to the high-road. At the cross-roads, the fourth arm
 of which led down to the village, stood the country-shop, which was also a hedge-alehouse. As they
 approached the alehouse, they heard a great noise inside. Then the door burst open, and some men poured
 out, rolling the figure of a man before them on the ground. â€œThe police have taken them by surprise!â€
 said Lasse, and drew the boy with him out into the ploughed field, so as to get past without being seen.
 But at that moment some one placed a lamp in the window, and they were discovered. â€œThereâ€™s the
 Stone Farm herdsman!â€ said a voice. â€œHi, Lasse! Come here!â€ They went up and saw a man lying
 face downward on the ground, kicking; his hands were tied behind his back, and he could not keep his
 face out of the mud. â€œWhy, itâ€™s Per Olsen!â€ exclaimed Lasse. â€œYes, of course!â€ said the
 shopkeeper. â€œCanâ€™t you take him home with you? Heâ€™s not right in his head.â€ Lasse looked
 hesitatingly at the boy, and then back again. â€œA raving man?â€ he said. â€œWe two canâ€™t alone.â€
 â€œOh, his hands are tied. Youâ€™ve only got to hold the end of the rope and heâ€™ll go along quietly
 with you,â€ said one of the men. They were quarrymen from the stone-quarry. â€œYouâ€™ll go with
 them quietly, wonâ€™t you?â€ he asked, giving the man a kick in the side with the toe of his wooden
 shoe. â€œOh dear! Oh dear!â€ groaned Per Olsen. â€œWhatâ€™s he done?â€ asked Lasse. â€œAnd why
 have you ill-used him so?â€ â€œWe had to thrash him a little, because he was going to chop off one of
 his thumbs. He tried it several times, the beast, and got it half off; and we had to beat him to make him
 stop.â€ And they showed Lasse the manâ€™s thumb, which was bleeding. â€œSuch an animal to begin
 cutting and hacking at himself because heâ€™s drunk half a pint of gin! If he wanted to fight, there
 were men enough here without that!â€ â€œIt must be tied up, or heâ€™ll bleed to death, poor fellow!â€
 said Lasse, slowly drawing out his red pocket-handkerchief. It was his best handkerchief, and it
 had just been washed. The shopkeeper came with a bottle and poured spirit over the thumb, so that the
 cold should not get into it. The wounded man screamed and beat his face upon the ground. â€œWonâ€™t
 one of you come with us?â€ asked Lasse. But no one answered; they wanted to have nothing to do with
 it, in case it should come to the ears of the magistrate. â€œWell, then, we two must do it with Godâ€™s
 help,â€ he said, in a trembling voice, turning to Pelle. â€œBut you can help him up at any rate, as
 you knocked him down.â€ They lifted him up. His face was bruised and bleeding; in their eagerness
 to save his finger, they had handled him so roughly that he could scarcely stand. â€œItâ€™s Lasse
 and Pelle,â€ said the old man, trying to wipe his face. â€œYou know us, donâ€™t you, Per Olsen? Weâ€™ll
 go home with you if youâ€™ll be good and not hurt us; we mean well by you, we two.â€ Per Olsen stood and
 ground his teeth, trembling all over his body. â€œOh dear, oh dear!â€ was all he said. There was white
 foam at the corners of his mouth. Lasse gave Pelle the end of the rope to hold. â€œHeâ€™s grinding his
 teeth; the devilâ€™s busy with him already,â€ he whispered. â€œBut if he tries to do any harm, just
 you pull with all your might at the rope; and if the worst comes to the worst, we must jump over the ditch.â€
 They now set off homeward, Lasse holding Per Olsen under the arm, for he staggered and would have fallen
 at almost every step. He kept on murmuring to himself or grinding his teeth. Pelle trudged behind,
 holding the rope. Cold shivers ran down his back, partly from fear, partly from secret satisfaction.
 He had now seen some one whom he knew to be doomed to perdition! So those who became devils in the next
 world looked like Per Olsen? But he wasnâ€™t unkind! He was the nicest of the farm men to Pelle, and
 he had bought that bottle for themâ€”yes, and had advanced the money out of his own pocket until May-day!
 VIII Oh! what a pace she was driving at! The farmer whipped up the gray stallion, and sat looking steadily
 out over the fields, as if he had no suspicion that any one was following him; but his wife certainly
 did not mind. She whipped the bay as hard as she could, and did not care who saw her. And it was in broad
 daylight that they were playing the fool like this on the high-road, instead of keeping their quarrels
 within four walls as decent people did! It was true enough that gentle folks had no feeling of shame
 in them! Then she called out and stood up in the trap to beat the horseâ€”with the handle even! Couldnâ€™t
 she let him drive out in peace to his fair charmer, whoever she was, and make it warm for him when he came
 home? How could she do the same thing over and over again for twenty years? Really women were persevering
 creatures! And how _he_ could be bothered! Having everlasting disturbances at home for the sake
 of some hotel landlady or some other woman, who could not be so very different to be with than his own
 wife! It would take a long-suffering nature to be a brute in that way; but that must be what they call
 love, properly speaking. The threshing-machine had come to a standstill, and the people at Stone
 Farm were hanging out of the doors and windows, enjoying it royally. It was a race, and a sight for the
 gods to see the bay mare gaining upon the stallion; why, it was like having two Sundays in one week!
 Lasse had come round the corner, and was following the mad race, his hand shading his eyes. Never had
 he known such a woman; Bengta was a perfect lamb compared to her! The farmer at Kaase Farm, who was standing
 at his gate when they dashed past, was secretly of the same opinion; and the workers in the fields dropped
 their implements, stared and were scandalized at the sight. At last, for very shame, he had to stop
 and turn round. She crawled over into his carriage, and the bay followed quietly with her empty vehicle.
 She put her arm about his shoulder, and looked happy and triumphant, exactly like the district policeman
 when he has had a successful chase; but he looked like a criminal of the worst kind. In this way they
 came driving back to the farm. One day Kalle came to borrow ten krones and to invite Lasse and Pelle
 to the christening-party on the following Sunday. Lasse, with some difficulty, obtained the money
 from the bailiff up in the office, but to the invitation they had to say â€œNo, thank you,â€ hard though
 it was; it was quite out of the question for them to get off again. Another day the head man had disappeared.
 He had gone in the night, and had taken his big chest with him, so some one must have helped him; but the
 other men in the room swore solemnly that they had noticed nothing, and the bailiff, fume as he might,
 was obliged to give up the attempt to solve the mystery. One or two things of this kind happened that
 made a stir for a day or two, but with these exceptions the winter was hard to get through. Darkness
 ruled for the greater part of the twenty-four hours, and it was never quite light in the corners. The
 cold, too, was hard to bear, except when you were in the comfortable stable. In there it was always
 warm, and Pelle was not afraid of going about in the thickest darkness. In the servantsâ€™ room they
 sat moping through the long evenings without anything to occupy themselves with. They took very
 little notice of the girls, but sat playing cards for gin, or telling horrible stories that made it
 a most venturesome thing to run across the yard down to the stable when you had to go to bed. Per Olsen,
 on account of his good behavior, was raised to the position of head man when the other ran away. Lasse
 and Pelle were glad of this, for he took their part when they were put upon by any one. He had become a
 decent fellow in every respect, hardly ever touched spirits, and kept his clothes in good order.
 He was a little too quiet even for the old day-laborers of the farm and their wives; but they knew the
 reason of it and liked him because he took the part of the weak and because of the fate that hung over
 him. They said he was always listening; and when he seemed to be listening within to the unknown, they
 avoided as far as possible disturbing him. â€œYouâ€™ll see heâ€™ll free himself; the Evil Oneâ€™ll
 have no claim upon him,â€ was the opinion of both Lasse and the laborersâ€™ wives when they discussed
 Per Olsenâ€™s prospects at the Sunday milking. â€œThere are some people that even the Almighty canâ€™t
 find anything to blame for.â€ Pelle listened to this, and tried every day to peep at the scar on Per
 Olsenâ€™s thumb. It would surely disappear when God removed his judgment! During most of the winter
 Pelle drove the horse for the threshing- machine. All day he trotted round upon the horse-way outside
 the farm, over his wooden shoes in trodden-down snow and manure. It was the most intolerable occupation
 that life had yet offered him. He could not even carve, it was too cold for his fingers; and he felt lonely.
 As a herd-boy he was his own master, and a thousand things called to him; but here he had to go round and
 round behind a bar, always round. His one diversion was to keep count of the times he drove round, but
 that was a fatiguing employment and made you even duller than the everlasting going round, and you
 could not leave off. Time held nothing of interest, and short as it was the day seemed endless. As a
 rule, Pelle awoke happy, but now every morning when he woke he was weary of everything; it was to be
 that everlasting trudging round behind the bar. After a time doing this for about an hour used to make
 him fall into a state of half-sleep. The condition came of itself, and he longed for it before it came.
 It was a kind of vacuity, in which he wished for nothing and took no interest in anything, but only staggered
 along mechanically at the back of the bar. The machine buzzed unceasingly, and helped to maintain
 the condition; the dust kept pouring out at the window, and the time passed imperceptibly. Generally
 now dinner or evening surprised him, and sometimes it seemed to him that the horses had only just been
 harnessed when some one came out to help him in with them. He had arrived at the condition of torpor
 that is the only mercy that life vouchsafes to condemned prisoners and people who spend their lives
 beside a machine. But there was a sleepiness about him even in his free time; he was not so lively and
 eager to know about everything; Father Lasse missed his innumerable questions and little devices.
 Now and again he was roused for a moment out of his condition by the appearance at the window of a black,
 perspiring face, that swore at him because he was not driving evenly. He knew then that Long Ole had
 taken the place of Per Olsen, whose business it was to feed the machine. It sometimes happened, too,
 that the lash of the whip caught on the axle and wound round it, so that the whole thing had to be stopped
 and drawn backward; and that day he did not fall into a doze again. In March the larks appeared and brought
 a little life. Snow still lay in the hollows, but their singing reminded Pelle warmly of summer and
 grazing cattle. And one day he was wakened in his tramp round and round by seeing a starling on the roof
 of the house, whistling and preening its feathers in delight. On that day the sun shone brightly,
 and all heaviness was gone from the air; but the sea was still a pale gray down there. Pelle began to
 be a human being again. It was spring, and then, too, in a couple of days the threshing would be finished.
 But after all, the chief thing was that waistcoat-pocket of his; that was enough to put life into its
 owner. He ran round in a trot behind the bar; he had to drive quickly now in order to get done, for every
 one else was in the middle of spring ploughing already. When he pressed his hand against his chest,
 he could distinctly feel the paper it was wrapped in. For it was still there, wasnâ€™t it? It would
 not do to open the paper and look; he must find out by squeezing. Pelle had become the owner of fifty
 Ã¶resâ€”a perfectly genuine fifty-Ã¶re piece. It was the first time he had ever possessed anything
 more than two and one Ã¶re pieces, and he had earned it by his own cleverness. It was on Sunday, when
 the men had had a visit from some quarrymen, and one of them had hit upon the idea of sending for some
 birch-fat to have with their dram. Pelle was to run to the village shop for it, and he was given a half-krone
 and injunctions to go in the back way, as it was Sunday. Pelle had not forgotten his experience at Christmas,
 and kept watch upon their faces. They were all doing their best to smooth them out and busy themselves
 with one thing and another; and Gustav, who gave him the money, kept turning his face away and looking
 at something out in the yard. When he stated his errand, the shopmanâ€™s wife broke into a laugh. â€œI
 say, donâ€™t you know better than that?â€ she exclaimed. â€œWhy, wasnâ€™t it you who fetched the
 handle-turner too? Youâ€™ve all found that very useful, havenâ€™t you?â€ Pelle turned crimson.
 â€œI thought they were making fun of me, but I didnâ€™t dare say no,â€ he said in a low voice. â€œNo,
 one has to play the fool sometimes, whether one is it or not,â€ said the woman. â€œWhat is birch-fat,
 then?â€ asked Pelle. â€œWhy, my gracious! You must have had it many a time, you little imp! But it
 shows how often you have to put up with things you donâ€™t know the name of.â€ A light dawned upon Pelle.
 â€œDoes it mean a thrashing with a birch-rod?â€ â€œDidnâ€™t I say you knew it?â€ â€œNo, Iâ€™ve
 only had it with a whipâ€”on my legs.â€ â€œWell, well, you neednâ€™t mind that; the one may be just
 as good as the other. But now sit down and drink a cup of coffee while I wrap up the article for them.â€
 She pushed a cup of coffee with brown sugar toward him, and began ladling out soft soap on to a piece
 of paper. â€œHere,â€ she said. â€œYou give them that: itâ€™s the best birch-fat. And you can keep
 the money yourself.â€ Pelle was not courageous enough for this arrangement. â€œVery well, then,â€
 she said. â€œIâ€™ll keep the money for you. They shanâ€™t make fools of us both. And then you can get
 it yourself. But now you must put on a bold face.â€ Pelle did put on a bold face, but he was decidedly
 nervous. The men swore at the loss of the half-krone, and called him the â€œgreatest idiot upon Godâ€™s
 green earthâ€; but he had the satisfaction of knowing that that was because he had not been stupid
 enough. And the half-krone was his! A hundred times a day he felt it without wearing it out. Here at
 last was something the possession of which did not rob it of its lustre. There was no end to the purchases
 he made with it, now for Lasse, now for himself. He bought the dearest things, and when he lingered
 long enough over one purchase and was satiated with the possession of it, he set about buying something
 else. And all the while he kept the coin. At times he would be suddenly seized with an insane fear that
 the money was gone; and then when he felt it, he was doubly happy. Pelle had suddenly become a capitalist,
 and by his own cleverness; and he made the most of his capital. He had already obtained every desirable
 thing that he knew ofâ€”he had it all, at any rate, in hand; and gradually as new things made their appearance
 in his world, he secured for himself the right to their purchase. Lasse was the only person who knew
 about his wealth, and he had reluctantly to allow himself to be drawn into the wildest of speculations.
 He could hear by the sound that there was something wrong with the machine. The horses heard it too,
 and stopped even before some one cried â€œStop!â€ Then one after another came the shouts: â€œStop!
 Drive on! Stop! On again! Stop! Pull!â€ And Pelle pulled the bar back, drove on and pulled until the
 whole thing whizzed again. Then he knew that it was Long Ole feeding the machine while Per Olsen measured
 the grain: Ole was a duffer at feeding. It was going smoothly again, and Pelle was keeping an eye on
 the corner by the cow-stable. When Lasse made his appearance there, and patted his stomach, it meant
 that it was nearly dinner-time. Something stopped the bar, the horses had to pull hard, and with a
 jerk it cleared the invisible hindrance. There was a cry from the inside of the threshing-barn, and
 the sound of many voices shouting â€œStop!â€ The horses stopped dead, and Pelle had to seize the
 bar to prevent it swinging forward against their legs. It was some time before any one came out and
 took the horses in, so that Pelle could go into the barn and see what was the matter. He found Long Ole
 walking about and writhing over one of his hands. His blouse was wrapped about it, but the blood was
 dripping through on to the floor of the barn. He was bending forward and stumbling along, throwing
 his body from side to side and talking incoherently. The girls, pale and frightened, were standing
 gazing at him while the men were quarreling as to what was the best thing to do to stop the flow of blood,
 and one of them came sliding down from the loft with a handful of cobwebs. Pelle went and peered into
 the machine to find out what there was so voracious about it. Between two of the teeth lay something
 like a peg, and when he moved the roller, the greater part of a finger dropped down on to the barn floor.
 He picked it up among some chaff, and took it to the others: it was a thumb! When Long Ole saw it, he fainted;
 it could hardly be wondered at, seeing that he was maimed for life. But Per Olsen had to own that he had
 left the machine at a fortunate moment. There was no more threshing done that day. In the afternoon
 Pelle played in the stable, for he had nothing to do. While he played, he suggested plans for their
 future to his father: they were engrossed in it. â€œThen weâ€™ll go to America, and dig for gold!â€
 â€œYe-es, that wouldnâ€™t be a bad thing at all. But it would take a good many more half-krones to make
 that journey.â€ â€œThen we can set up as stone-masons.â€ Lasse stood still in the middle of the
 foddering-passage, and pondered with bent head. He was exceedingly dissatisfied with their position;
 there were two of them toiling to earn a hundred krones, and they could not make ends meet. There was
 never any liberty either; they were simply slaves. By himself he never got any farther than being
 discontented and disappointed with everything; he was too old. The mere search for ways to something
 new was insuperable labor, and everything looked so hopeless. But Pelle was restless, and whenever
 he was dissatisfied with anything, made plans by the score, some of the wildest, and some fairly sensible;
 and the old man was carried away by them. â€œWe might go to the town and work too,â€ said Lasse meditatively.
 â€œThey earn one bright krone after another in there. But whatâ€™s to be done with you? Youâ€™re too
 little to use a tool.â€ This stubborn fact put a stop for the moment to Pelleâ€™s plans; but then his
 courage rose again. â€œI can quite well go with you to the town,â€ he said. â€œFor I shallâ€”â€”â€
 He nodded significantly. â€œWhat?â€ asked Lasse, with interest. â€œWell, perhaps Iâ€™ll go down
 to the harbor and be doing nothing, and a little girlâ€™ll fall into the water and I shall save her.
 But the little girl will be a gentlemanâ€™s daughter, and soâ€”â€”â€ Pelle left the rest to Lasseâ€™s
 imagination. â€œThen youâ€™d have to learn to swim first,â€ said Lasse gravely. â€œOr youâ€™d
 only be drowned.â€ Screams were heard from the menâ€™s bedroom. It was Long Ole. The doctor had come
 and was busy with his maimed hand. â€œJust run across and find out whatâ€™ll happen to it!â€ said
 Lasse. â€œNobodyâ€™ll pay any attention to you at such a time, if you make yourself small.â€ In a
 little while Pelle came back and reported that three fingers were quite crushed and hanging in rags,
 and the doctor had cut them off. â€œWas it these three?â€ asked Lasse, anxiously, holding up his
 thumb, forefinger, and middle finger. Truth to tell, Pelle had seen nothing, but his imagination
 ran away with him. â€œYes, it was his swearing-fingers,â€ he said, nodding emphatically. â€œThen
 Per Olsen is set free,â€ said Lasse, heaving a deep sigh. â€œWhat a _good_ thing it has beenâ€”quite
 providential!â€ That was Pelleâ€™s opinion too. The farmer himself drove the doctor home, and
 a little while after he had gone, Pelle was sent for, to go on an errand for the mistress to the village-shop.
 IX It was nothing for Pelle; if he were vanquished on one point, he rose again on two others: he was invincible.
 And he had the childâ€™s abundant capacity for forgiving; had he not he would have hated all grown-up
 people with the exception of Father Lasse. But disappointed he certainly was. It was not easy to say
 who had expected mostâ€”the boy, whose childish imagination had built, unchecked, upon all that
 he had heard, or the old man, who had once been here himself. But Pelle managed to fill his own existence
 with interest, and was so taken up on all sides that he only just had time to realize the disappointment
 in passing. His world was supersensual like that of the fakir; in the course of a few minutes a little
 seed could shoot up and grow into a huge tree that overshadowed everything else. Cause never answered
 to effect in it, and it was governed by another law of gravitation: events always bore him up. However
 hard reality might press upon him, he always emerged from the tight place the richer in some way or
 other; and no danger could ever become overwhelmingly great as long as Father Lasse stood reassuringly
 over and behind everything. But Lasse had failed him at the decisive moment more than once, and every
 time he used him as a threat, he was only laughed at. The old manâ€™s omnipotence could not continue
 to exist side by side with his increasing decrepitude; in the boyâ€™s eyes it crumbled away from day
 to day. Unwilling though he was, Pelle had to let go his providence, and seek the means of protection
 in himself. It was rather early, but he looked at circumstances in his own way. Distrust he had already
 acquiredâ€”and timidity! He daily made clumsy attempts to get behind what people said, and behind
 things. There was something more behind everything! It often led to confusion, but occasionally
 the result was conspicuously good. There were some thrashings that you could run away from, because
 in the meantime the anger would pass away, and other thrashings where it answered best to shed as many
 tears as possible. Most people only beat until the tears came, but the bailiff could not endure a blubberer,
 so with him the thing was to set your teeth and make yourself hard. People said you should speak the
 truth, but most thrashings could be avoided by making up a white lie, if it was a good one and you took
 care of your face. If you told the truth, they thrashed you at once. With regard to thrashing, the question
 had a subjective side as well as an objective one. He could beat Rud whenever he liked, but with bigger
 boys it was better to have right on his side, as, for instance, when his father was attacked. Then God
 helped him. This was a case in which the boy put the omnipotence quite aside, and felt himself to be
 the old manâ€™s protector. Lasse and Pelle were walking through life hand in hand, and yet each was
 going his own way. Lasse felt it to be so. â€œWeâ€™ve each got hold of an end,â€ he sometimes said to
 himself despondently, when the difference was all too marked. â€œHeâ€™s rising, the laddie!â€
 This was best seen in the others. In the long run they had to like the boy, it could not be otherwise.
 The men would sometimes give him things, and the girls were thoroughly kind to him. He was in the fairest
 period of budding youth; they would often take him on their knees as he passed, and kiss him. â€œAh,
 heâ€™ll be a ladyâ€™s man, he will!â€ Lasse would say. â€œHeâ€™s got that from his father.â€ But
 they would laugh at that. There was always laughter when Lasse wanted to join the elders. Last timeâ€”yes,
 then he was good enough. It was always â€œWhereâ€™s Lasse?â€ when gin was going round, or tricks
 were being played, or demonstrations made. â€œCall Lasse Karlsson!â€ He had no need to push himself
 forward; it was a matter of course that he was there. The girls were always on the look-out for him,
 married man though he was, and he had fun with themâ€”all quite proper, of course, for Bengta was not
 good to quarrel with if she heard anything. But now! Yesâ€”well, yesâ€”he might fetch the gin for
 the others and do their work for them when they had a holiday, without their doing anything in exchange!
 â€œLasse! Whereâ€™s Lasse? Can you feed the horses for me this evening? Can you take my place at the
 chaff-cutting to-morrow evening?â€ There was a difference between then and now, and Lasse had
 found out the reason for himself: he was getting old. The very discovery brought further proof of
 its correctness, laid infirmity upon him, and removed the tension from his mind, and what was left
 of it from his body. The hardest blow of all was when he discovered that he was of no importance to the
 girls, had no place at all in their thoughts of men. In Lasseâ€™s world there was no word that carried
 such weight as the word â€œmanâ€; and in the end it was the girls who decided whether you were one or
 not. Lasse was not one; he was not dangerous! He was only a few poor relics of a man, a comical remnant
 of some by-gone thing; they laughed at him when he tried to pay them attention. Their laughter crushed
 him, and he withdrew into his old-manâ€™s world, and despondently adapted himself to it. The only
 thing that kept life in him was his concern for the boy, and he clung despairingly to his position as
 his providence. There was little he could do for him, and therefore he talked all the bigger; and when
 anything went against the boy, he uttered still greater threats against the world than before. He
 also felt that the boy was in process of making himself independent, and fought a desperate battle
 to preserve the last appearance of power. But Pelle could not afford to give support to his fancy,
 nor had he the understanding to do it. He was growing fast, and had a use for all that he possessed himself.
 Now that his father no longer stood behind to shield him, he was like a small plant that has been moved
 out into the open, and is fighting hard to comprehend the nature of its surroundings, and adapt itself
 to them. For every root-fibre that felt its way into the soil, there fell to the ground one of the tender
 leaves, and two strong ones pushed forth. One after another the feelings of the childâ€™s defencelessness
 dropped and gave place to the harder ones of the individual. The boy was engaged in building himself
 up, in accordance with invisible laws. He assumed an attitude toward his surroundings at all points,
 but he did not imitate them. The farm men, for instance, were not kind to the animals. They often lashed
 the horses only as a vent for their ill-humor, and the girls were just the same to the smaller animals
 and the dairy-cows. From these considerations, Pelle taught himself sympathy. He could not bear
 cruelty to animals, and thrashed Rud for the first time when the latter had one day robbed a birdâ€™s
 nest. Pelle was like a kid that makes a plaything of everything. In his play he took up, without suspecting
 it, many of the serious phenomena of life, and gambolled with them in frolicsome bounds. He exercised
 his small mind as he exercised his body, twisted himself into everything and out of everything, imitated
 work and fun and shirking, and learned how to puff himself up into a very devil of a fellow where his
 surroundings were yielding, and to make himself almost invisible with modesty when they were hard.
 He was training himself to be that little Jack-of-all-trades, man. And it became more and more difficult
 to catch him unprepared. The first time he had to set about a thing in earnest, he was generally handy
 at it; he was as difficult to take unawares as a cat. It was summer again. The heat stood still and played
 over the ground, sparkling, with indolent voluptuousness and soft movements like the fish in the
 stream. Far inland it quivered above the rocks that bounded the view, in a restless flicker of bluish
 white; below lay the fields beneath the broiling sun, with the pollen from the rye drifting over them
 like smoke. Up above the clover-field stood the cows of Stone Farm in long rows, their heads hanging
 heavily down, and their tails swinging regularly. Lasse was moving between their ranks, looking
 for the mallet, and now and then gazing anxiously down towards the meadow by the dunes, and beginning
 to count the young cattle and the bullocks. Most of them were lying down, but a few of them were standing
 with their heads close together, and munching with closed eyes. The boys were nowhere to be seen.
 Lasse stood wondering whether he should give Pelle a warning call; there would he no end of a row if
 the bailiff were to come now. But then the sound of voices came from among the young firs on the dunes,
 a naked boy appeared, and then another. Their bodies were like golden flashes in the air as they ran
 over the grass-wrack and across the meadow, each with his cap held closed in his hand. They sat down
 upon the edge of the stream with their feet in the water, and carefully uncovered their captives;
 they were dragon-flies. As the insects one by one crawled out at the narrow opening, the boys decapitated
 them and laid them in a row on the grass. They had caught nine, and nine times thirty-fiveâ€”well,
 it would be more than three krones. The stupendous amount made Pelle skeptical. â€œNow isnâ€™t that
 only a lie?â€ he said, and licked his shoulder where he had been bitten by a mosquito. It was said that
 the chemist gave thirty-five Ã¶res apiece for dragon-flies. â€œA lie?â€ exclaimed Rud. â€œYes,
 perhaps it is,â€ he went on meekly. â€œIt must be a lie, for anything like that always is. You might
 give me yours too!â€ But Pelle would not do that. â€œThen give me your half-krone, and Iâ€™ll go to
 the town and sell them for you. They cost thirty-five Ã¶res, for Karl says so, and his mother washes
 the floor in the chemistâ€™s shop.â€ Pelle got up, not to fetch the half-kroneâ€”he would not part
 with that for all the worldâ€”but to assure himself that it still lay in his waistcoat pocket. When
 he had gone a little way, Rud hastily lifted a piece of turf at the edge of the stream, pushed something
 in under it, and jumped into the water; and when Pelle came back with slow, ominous steps, he climbed
 up the other side and set off at a run. Pelle ran too, in short, quick leaps. He knew he was the quicker,
 and the knowledge made him frolicsome. He flapped at his naked body as he ran, as if he had no joints,
 swayed from side to side like a balloon, pranced and stamped on the ground, and then darted on again.
 Then the young firs closed round them again, only the movement of their tops showing where the boys
 ran, farther and farther, until all was still. In the meadow the cattle were munching with closed
 eyes and attentive ears. The heat played over the ground, flickering, gasping, like a fish in water.
 There was a heavy, stupefying humming in the air; the sound came from everywhere and nowhere. Down
 across the cornfields came a big, stout woman. She wore a skirt, a chemise, and a handkerchief on her
 head, and she shaded her eyes with her hand and looked about. She crossed the meadow obliquely, found
 Pelleâ€™s dinner-basket, took out its contents and put them in under her chemise upon her bare, perspiring
 bosom, and then turned in the direction of the sea. There was a sudden break in the edge of the fir-plantation,
 and out came Rud with Pelle hanging upon his back. Rudâ€™s inordinately large head hung forward and
 his knees gave way; his forehead, which receded above the eyes and projected just below the line of
 the hair, was a mass of bruises and scars, which became very visible now with his exertions. Both the
 boys had marks all over their bodies from the poison of the pine-needles. Pelle dropped on to the grass,
 and lay there on his face, while Rud went slowly to fetch the half-krone, and handed it reluctantly
 to its owner. He stooped like one vanquished, but in his eye the thought of a new battle lay awaiting
 its opportunity. Pelle gazed lovingly at the coin. He had had it now ever since April, from the time
 when he was sent to buy birch-fat. He had purchased with it everything that was desirable, and he had
 lost it twice: he loved that piece of money. It made his fingers itch, his whole body; it was always
 urging him on to spend it, now in one way and now in another. Roll, roll! That was what it was longing
 to do; and it was because it was round, Father Lasse said. But to become richâ€”that meant stopping
 the money as it rolled. Oh, Pelle meant to be rich! And then he was always itching to spend itâ€”spend
 it in such a way that he got everything for it, or something he could have all his life. They sat upon
 the bank of the stream and wrangled in a small way. Rud did his best to inspire awe, and bragged to create
 an impression. He bent his fingers backward and moved his ears; he could move them forward in a listening
 position like a horse. All this irritated Pelle intensely. Suddenly he stopped. â€œWonâ€™t you
 give me the half-krone, then? You shall have ten krones when I grow up.â€ Rud collected moneyâ€”he
 was avaricious alreadyâ€”and had a whole boxful of coins that he had stolen from his mother. Pelle
 considered a little. â€œNo,â€ he said. â€œBecause youâ€™ll never grow up; youâ€™re a dwarf!â€
 The tone of his voice was one of sheer envy. â€œThatâ€™s what the Sow says too! But then Iâ€™ll show
 myself for money at the fairs and on Midsummer Eve on the common. Then I shall get frightfully rich.â€
 Pelle was inwardly troubled. Should he give him the whole fifty Ã¶res for nothing at all? He had never
 heard of any one doing such a thing. And perhaps some day, when Rud had become enormously rich, he would
 get half of it. â€œWill you have it?â€ he asked, but regretted it instantly. Rud stretched out his
 hand eagerly, but Pelle spat into it. â€œIt can wait until weâ€™ve had our dinner anyhow,â€ he said,
 and went over to the basket. For a little while they stood gazing into the empty basket. â€œThe Sowâ€™s
 been here,â€ said Rud, putting out his tongue. Pelle nodded. â€œShe _is_ a beast!â€ â€œA thief,â€
 said Rud. They took the sunâ€™s measure. Rud declared that if you could see it when you bent down and
 looked between your legs, then it was five oâ€™clock. Pelle began to put on his clothes. Rud was circling
 about him. â€œI say!â€ he said suddenly. â€œIf I may have it, Iâ€™ll let you whip me with nettles.â€
 â€œOn your bare body?â€ asked Pelle. Rud nodded. In a second Pelle was out of his trousers again,
 and running to a patch of nettles. He pulled them up with the assistance of a dock-leak, as many as he
 could hold, and came back again. Rud lay down, face downwards, on a little mound, and the whipping
 began. The agreement was a hundred strokes, but when Rud had received ten, he got up and refused to
 have any more. â€œThen you wonâ€™t get the money,â€ said Pelle. â€œWill you or wonâ€™t you?â€ He
 was red with excitement and the exertion, and the perspiration already stood in beads down his slender
 back, for he had worked with a will. â€œWill you or wonâ€™t you? Seventy-five strokes then!â€ Pelleâ€™s
 voice quivered with eagerness, and he had to dilate his nostrils to get air enough; his limbs began
 to tremble. â€œNoâ€”only sixtyâ€”you hit so hard! And I must have the money first, or you may cheat
 me.â€ â€œI donâ€™t cheat,â€ said Pelle gloomily. But Rud held to his point. Pelleâ€™s body writhed;
 he was like a ferret that has tasted blood. With a jerk he threw the coin at Rud, and grumbling, pushed
 him down. He wept inwardly because he had let him off forty strokes; but he made up his mind to lay into
 him all the harder for it. Then he beat, slowly and with all his might, while Rud burrowed with his head
 in the grass and clasped the money tightly to keep up his strength. There was hatred in every stroke
 that Pelle struck, and they went like shocks through his playmateâ€™s body, but he never uttered
 a cry. No, there was no point in his crying, for the coin he held in his hand took away the pain. But about
 Pelleâ€™s body the air burnt like fire, his arms began to give way with fatigue, and his inclination
 diminished with every stroke. It was toil, nothing but hard toil. And the moneyâ€”the beautiful
 half-kroneâ€”was slipping farther and farther away, and he would be poor once more; and Rud was not
 even crying! At the forty-sixth stroke he turned his face and put out his tongue, whereat Pelle burst
 into a roar, threw down the frayed nettle-stalks, and ran away to the fir-plantation. There he sat
 for the rest of the day under a dune, grieving over his loss, while Rud lay under the bank of the stream,
 bathing his blistered body with wet earth. X After all, Per Olsen was not the sort of man they had thought
 him. Now that he had been set free in that way, the thing would have been for him to have given a helping
 hand to that poor fellow, Long Ole; for after all it was for his sake that Oleâ€™s misfortune had come
 upon him. But did he do it? No, he began to amuse himself. It was drinking and dissipation and petticoats
 all the summer through; and now at Martinmas he left and took work at the quarry, so as to be more his
 own master. There was not sufficient liberty for him at Stone Farm. What good there was left in him
 would find something to do up there. Long Ole could not, of course, remain at Stone Farm, crippled
 as he was. Through kindness on the part of the farmer, he was paid his half-wage; that was more than
 he had any claim to, and enough at any rate to take him home and let him try something or other. There
 were many kinds of work that at a pinch could be performed with one hand; and now while he had the money
 he ought to have got an iron hook; it could be strapped to the wrist, and was not bad to hold tools with.
 But Ole had grown weak and had great difficulty in making up his mind. He continued to hang about the
 farm, notwithstanding all that the bailiff did to get him away. At last they had to put his things out,
 to the west of the farm; and there they lay most of the summer, while he himself slept among the stacks,
 and begged food of the workers in the fields. But this could not go on when the cold set in. But then one
 day in the autumn, his things were gone. Johanna Pihl â€”commonly called the Sowâ€”had taken him
 in. She felt the cold, too, in spite of her fat, and as the proverb says: Itâ€™s easier for two to keep
 warm than one; but whatever was her reason for doing it, Long Ole might thank his Maker for her. There
 was always bacon hanging in her chimney. Lasse and Pelle looked forward to term-day with anxiety.
 What changes would it bring this time for people? So much depended on that. Besides the head man, they
 were to have new second and third men and some new maids. They were always changing at Stone Farm when
 they could. Karna, poor soul, was bound to stay, as she had set her mind upon youth, and would absolutely
 be where Gustav was! Gustav stayed because Bodil stayed, so unnaturally fond was he of that girl,
 although she was not worth it. And Bodil herself knew well enough what she was doing! There must be
 more in it than met the eye when a girl dressed, as she did, in expensive, town-bought clothes. Lasse
 and Pelle _remained_, simply because there was no other place in the world for them to go to. All through
 the year they made plans for making a change, but when the time for giving notice approached, Lasse
 became quiet and let it go past. Of late he had given no little thought to the subject of marrying again.
 There was something God-forsaken about this solitary existence for a man of his age; you became old
 and worn out before your time, when you hadnâ€™t a wife and a house. On the heath near Brother Kalleâ€™s,
 there was a house that he could have without paying anything down. He often discussed it with Pelle,
 and the boy was ready for anything new. It should be a wife who could look after everything and make
 the house comfortable; and above all she must be a hard-working woman. It would not come amiss either
 if she had a little of her own, but let that be as it might, if only she was good-natured. Karna would
 have suited in all respects, both Lasse and Pelle having always had a liking for her ever since the
 day she freed Pelle from the pupilâ€™s clutches; but it was nothing to offer her as long as she was so
 set upon Gustav. They must bide their time; perhaps she would come to her senses, or something else
 might turn up. â€œThen thereâ€™d be coffee in bed on Sunday mornings!â€ said Pelle, with rapture.
 â€œYes, and perhaps weâ€™d get a little horse, and invite Brother Kalle for a drive now and then,â€
 added Lasse solemnly. At last it was really to be! In the evening Lasse and Pelle had been to the shop
 and bought a slate and pencil, and Pelle was now standing at the stable-door with a beating heart and
 the slate under his arm. It was a frosty October morning, but the boy was quite hot after his wash. He
 had on his best jacket, and his hair had been combed with water. Lasse hovered about him, brushing
 him here and there with his sleeve, and was even more nervous than the boy. Pelle had been born to poor
 circumstances, had been christened, and had had to earn his bread from the time he was a little boyâ€”all
 exactly as he had done himself. So far there was no difference to be seen; it might very well have been
 Lasse himself over again, from the big ears and the â€œcowâ€™s-lickâ€ on the forehead, to the way
 the boy walked and wore out the bottoms of his trouser-legs. But this was something strikingly new.
 Neither Lasse nor any of his family had ever gone to school; it was something new that had come within
 the reach of his family, a blessing from Heaven that had fallen upon the boy and himself. It felt like
 a push upward; the impossible was within reach; what might not happen to a person who had book-learning!
 You might become master of a workshop, a clerk, perhaps even a schoolmaster. â€œNow do take care of
 the slate, and see that you donâ€™t break it!â€ he said admonishingly. â€œAnd keep out of the way
 of the big boys until you can hold your own with them. But if any of them simply wonâ€™t let you alone,
 mind you manage to hit first! That takes the inclination out of most of them, especially if you hit
 hard; he who hits first hits twice, as the old proverb says. And then you must listen well, and keep
 in mind all that your teacher says; and if anyone tries to entice you into playing and larking behind
 his back, donâ€™t do it. And remember that youâ€™ve got a pocket-handkerchief, and donâ€™t use your
 fingers, for that isnâ€™t polite. If thereâ€™s no one to see you, you can save the handkerchief, of
 course, and then itâ€™ll last all the longer. And take care of your nice jacket. And if the teacherâ€™s
 lady invites you in to coffee, you mustnâ€™t take more than one piece of cake, mind.â€ Lasseâ€™s
 hands trembled while he talked. â€œSheâ€™s sure not to do that,â€ said Pelle, with a superior air.
 â€œWell, well, now go, so that you donâ€™t get there too lateâ€”the very first day, too. And if thereâ€™s
 some tool or other wanting, you must say weâ€™ll get it at once, for we arenâ€™t altogether paupers!â€
 And Lasse slapped his pocket; but it did not make much noise, and Pelle knew quite well that they had
 no money; they had got the slate and pencil on credit. Lasse stood looking after the boy as long as he
 was in sight, and then went to his work of crushing oilcakes. He put them into a vessel to soak, and poured
 water on them, all the while talking softly to himself. There was a knock at the outside stable-door,
 and Lasse went to open it. It was Brother Kalle. â€œGood-day, brother!â€ he said, with his cheerful
 smile. â€œHere comes his Majesty from the quarries!â€ He waddled in upon his bow legs, and the two
 exchanged hearty greetings. Lasse was delighted at the visit. â€œWhat a pleasant time we had with
 you the other evening!â€ said Lasse, taking his brother by the hand. â€œThatâ€™s a long time ago
 now. But you must look in again one evening soon. Grandmother looks upon both of you with a favorable
 eye!â€ Kalleâ€™s eyes twinkled mischievously. â€œHow is she, poor body? Has she at all got over
 the hurt to her eye? Pelle came home the other day and told me that the children had been so unfortunate
 as to put a stick into her eye. It quite upset me. You had to have the doctor, too!â€ â€œWell, it wasnâ€™t
 quite like that,â€ said Kalle. â€œI had moved grandmotherâ€™s spinning-wheel myself one morning
 when I was putting her room to rights, and then I forgot to put it back in its place. Then when she was
 going to stoop down to pick up something from the floor, the spindle went into her eye; of course sheâ€™s
 used to have everything stand exactly in its place. So really the honorâ€™s due to me.â€ He smiled
 all over his face. Lasse shook his head sympathetically. â€œAnd she got over it fairly well?â€ he
 asked. â€œNo; it went altogether wrong, and she lost the sight of that eye.â€ Lasse looked at him
 with disapproval. Kalle caught himself up, apparently very much horrified. â€œEh, what nonsense
 Iâ€™m talking! She lost the _blindness_ of that eye, I ought to have said. _Isnâ€™t_ that all wrong,
 too? You put somebodyâ€™s eye out, and she begins to see! Upon my word, I think Iâ€™ll set up as an eye-doctor
 after this, for thereâ€™s not much difficulty in it.â€ â€œWhat do you say? Sheâ€™s begun toâ€”?
 Now youâ€™re too merry! You oughtnâ€™t to joke about everything.â€ â€œWell, well, joking apart,
 as the prophet said when his wife scratched himâ€”she can really see with that eye now.â€ Lasse looked
 suspiciously at him for a little while before he yielded. â€œWhy, itâ€™s quite a miracle!â€ he then
 said. â€œYes, thatâ€™s what the doctor said. The point of the spindle had acted as a kind of operation.
 But it might just as easily have taken the other direction. Yes, we had the doctor to her three times;
 it was no use being niggardly.â€ Kalle stood and tried to look important; he had stuck his thumbs
 into his waistcoat pockets. â€œIt cost a lot of money, I suppose?â€ â€œThatâ€™s what I thought,
 too, and I wasnâ€™t very happy when I asked the doctor how much it would be. Twenty-five krones, he
 said, and it didnâ€™t sound anything more than when any of us ask for a piece of bread-and-dripping.
 â€˜Will the doctor be so kind as to wait a few days so that I can get the cow properly sold?â€™ I asked.
 â€˜What!â€™ he says, and glares at me over his spectacles. â€˜You donâ€™t mean to sell the cow so as
 to pay me? You mustnâ€™t do that on any account; Iâ€™ll wait till times are better.â€™ â€˜We come off
 easily, even if we get rid of the cow,â€™ I said. â€˜How so?â€™ he asks, as we go out to the carriage â€”it
 was the farmer of Kaase Farm that was driving for me. So I told him that Maria and I had been thinking
 of selling everything so that grandmother might go over and be operated. He said nothing to that,
 but climbed up into the carriage; but while I was standing like this, buttoning up his foot-bag, he
 seizes me by the collar and says: â€˜Do you know, you little bow-legged creature!â€™ (Kalle imitated
 the doctorâ€™s town speech), â€˜Youâ€™re the best man Iâ€™ve ever met, and you donâ€™t owe me a brass
 farthing! For that matter, it was you yourself that performed the operation.â€™ â€˜Then I ought
 almost to have had the money,â€™ I said. Then he laughed and gave me a box on the ears with his fur cap.
 Heâ€™s a fine man, that doctor, and fearfully clever; they say that he has one kind of mixture that
 he cures all kinds of illness with.â€ They were sitting in the herdsmanâ€™s room upon the green chest,
 and Lasse had brought out a little gin. â€œDrink, brother!â€ he said again and again. â€œIt takes
 something to keep out this October drizzle.â€ â€œMany thanks, but you must drink! But I was going
 to say, you should see grandmother! She goes round peeping at everything with her one eye; if itâ€™s
 only a button, she keeps on staring at it. So thatâ€™s what that looks like, and that! Sheâ€™s forgotten
 what the things look like, and when she sees a thing, she goes to it to feel it afterward â€”to find out
 what it is, she actually says. She would have nothing to do with us the first few days; when she didnâ€™t
 hear us talk or walk, she thought we were strangers, even though she saw us there before her eyes.â€
 â€œAnd the little ones?â€ asked Lasse. â€œThank you, Annaâ€™s is fat and well, but our own seems
 to have come to a standstill. After all, itâ€™s the young pigs you ought to breed with. By the byeâ€â€”Kalle
 took out his purseâ€”â€œwhile weâ€™re at it, donâ€™t let me forget the ten krones I got from you for
 the christenings.â€ Lasse pushed it away. â€œNever mind that,â€ he said. â€œYou may have a lot
 to go through yet. How many mouths are there now? Fourteen or fifteen, I suppose?â€ â€œYes; but two
 take their motherâ€™s milk, like the parsonâ€™s wifeâ€™s chickens; so thatâ€™s all saved. And if
 things became difficult, oneâ€™s surely man enough to wring a few pence out of oneâ€™s nose?â€ He
 seized his nose and gave it a rapid twist, and held out his hand. A folded ten-krone note lay in it. Lasse
 laughed at the trick, but would not hear of taking the money; and for a time it passed backward and forward
 between them. â€œWell, well!â€ said Kalle at last, keeping the note; â€œthank you very much, then!
 And good-bye, brother! I must be going.â€ Lasse went out with him, and sent many greetings. â€œWe
 shall come and look you up very soon,â€ he called out after his brother. When after a little while
 he returned to his room, the note lay upon the bed. Kalle must have seen his opportunity to put it there,
 conjurer that he was. Lasse put it aside to give to Kalleâ€™s wife, when an occasion presented itself.
 Long before the time, Lasse was on the lookout for Pelle. He found the solitude wearisome, now that
 he was used to having the boy about him from morning till night. At last he came, out of breath with running,
 for he had longed to get home too. Nothing either terrible or remarkable had happened at school. Pelle
 had to give a circumstantial account, point by point, â€œWell, what can you do?â€ the master had
 asked, taking him by the earâ€”quite kindly, of course. â€œI can pull the mad bull to the water without
 Father Lasse helping at all,â€ Pelle had answered, and then the whole class had laughed. â€œYes,
 yes, but can you read?â€ No, Pelle could not do thatâ€”â€œor else I shouldnâ€™t have come here,â€
 he was on the point of adding. â€œIt was a good thing you didnâ€™t answer that,â€ said Lasse; â€œbut
 what more then?â€ Well, then Pelle was put upon the lowest bench, and the boy next him was set to teach
 him his letters. â€œDo you know them, then?â€ No, Pelle did not know them that day, but when a couple
 of weeks had passed, he knew most of them, and wrote them with chalk on the posts. He had not learned
 to write, but his hand could imitate anything he had seen, and he drew the letters just as they stood
 in print in the spelling-book. Lasse went and looked at them during his work, and had them repeated
 to him endlessly; but they would not stick properly. â€œWhatâ€™s that one there?â€ he was perpetually
 asking. Pelle answered with a superior air: â€œThat? Have you forgotten it already? I knew that after
 Iâ€™d only seen it once! Thatâ€™s M.â€ â€œYes, of course it is! I canâ€™t think where my head is to-day.
 M, yesâ€”of course itâ€™s M! Now what can that be used for, eh?â€ â€œItâ€™s the first letter in the
 word â€˜empty,â€™ of course!â€ said Pelle consequentially. â€œYes, of course! But you didnâ€™t
 find that out for yourself; the master told you.â€ â€œNo, I found it out by myself.â€ â€œDid you,
 now? Well, youâ€™ve become cleverâ€”if only you donâ€™t become as clever as seven fools.â€ Lasse
 was out of spirits; but very soon he gave in, and fell into whole-hearted admiration of his son. And
 the instruction was continued while they worked. It was fortunate for Pelle that his father was so
 slow, for he did not get on very fast himself, when once he had mastered all that was capable of being
 picked up spontaneously by a quick intelligence. The boy who had to teach himâ€”Sloppy, he was calledâ€”was
 the dunce of the class and had always been bottom until now Pelle had come and taken his place. Two weeks
 of school had greatly changed Pelleâ€™s ideas on this subject. On the first few days he arrived in
 a state of anxious expectation, and all his courage forsook him as he crossed the threshold of the
 school. For the first time in his life he felt that he was good for nothing. Trembling with awe, he opened
 his perceptions to this new and unfamiliar thing that was to unveil for him all the mysteries of the
 world, if only he kept his ears open; and he did so. But there was no awe-inspiring man, who looked at
 them affectionately through gold-rimmed spectacles while he told them about the sun and the moon
 and all the wonders of the world. Up and down the middle passage walked a man in a dirty linen coat and
 with gray bristles projecting from his nostrils. As he walked he swung the cane and smoked his pipe;
 or he sat at the desk and read the newspaper. The children were noisy and restless, and when the noise
 broke out into open conflict, the man dashed down from his desk, and hit out indiscriminately with
 his cane. And Pelle himself, well he was coupledâ€”for good, it appearedâ€”to a dirty boy, covered
 with scrofulous sores, who pinched his arm every time he read his b-aâ€”ba, b-eâ€”be wrong. The only
 variation was an hourâ€™s daily examination in the tedious observations in the class-book, and
 the Saturdayâ€™s uncouth hymn-repeating. For a time Pelle swallowed everything whole, and passed
 it on faithfully to his father; but at last he tired of it. It was not his nature to remain long passive
 to his surroundings, and one fine day he had thrown aside all injunctions and intentions, and dived
 into the midst of the fun. After this he had less information to impart, but on the other hand there
 were the thousands of knavish tricks to tell about. And father Lasse shook his head and comprehended
 nothing; but he could not help laughing. XI â€œA safe stronghold our God is still, A trusty shield
 and weaâ€”pon; Heâ€™ll help us clear from all the ill That hath us now oâ€™ertaâ€”ken. The ancient
 prince of hell Hath risen with purpose fell; Strong mail of craft and power He weareth in this hour;
 On earth is not his felâ€”low.â€ The whole school sat swaying backward and forward in time to the
 rhythm, grinding out hymns in endless succession. Fris, the master, was walking up and down the middle
 passage, smoking his pipe; he was taking exercise after an hourâ€™s reading of the paper. He was using
 the cane to beat time with, now and then letting it descend upon the back of an offender, but always
 only at the end of a lineâ€”as a kind of note of admiration. Fris could not bear to have the rhythm broken.
 The children who did not know the hymn were carried along by the crowd, some of them contenting themselves
 with moving their lips, while others made up words of their own. When the latter were too dreadful,
 their neighbors laughed, and then the cane descended. When one verse came to an end, Fris quickly
 started the next; for the mill was hard to set in motion again when once it had come to a standstill.
 â€œWith forâ€”!â€ and the half-hundred children carried it onâ€” â€œWith force of arms we nothing
 can, Full soon were we downridâ€”den;â€ Then Fris had another breathing-space in which to enjoy
 his pipe and be lulled by this noise that spoke of great and industrious activity. When things went
 as they were now going, his exasperation calmed down for a time, and he could smile at his thoughts
 as he paced up and down, and, old though he was, look at the bright side of life. People in passing stopped
 to rejoice over the diligence displayed, and Fris beat more briskly with the cane, and felt a long-forgotten
 ideal stirring within him; he had this whole flock of children to educate for life, he was engaged
 in creating the coming generation. When the hymn came to an end, he got them, without a pause, turned
 on to â€œWho puts his trust in God alone,â€ and from that again to â€œWe all, we all have faith in God.â€
 They had had them all three the whole winter through, and now at last, after tremendous labor, he had
 brought them so far that they could say them more or less together. The hymn-book was the business
 of Frisâ€™s life, and his forty years as parish-clerk had led to his knowing the whole of it by heart.
 In addition to this he had a natural gift. As a child Fris had been intended for the ministry, and his
 studies as a young man were in accordance with that intention. Bible words came with effect from his
 lips, and his prospects were of the best, when an ill-natured bird came all the way from the Faroe Islands
 to bring trouble upon him. Fris fell down two flights from spiritual guide to parish-clerk and child-whipper.
 The latter office he looked upon as almost too transparent a punishment from Heaven, and arranged
 his school as a miniature clerical charge. The whole village bore traces of his work. There was not
 much knowledge of reading and writing, but when it was a question of hymns and Bible texts, these fishermen
 and little artisans were bad to beat. Fris took to himself the credit for the fairly good circumstances
 of the adults, and the receipt of proper wages by the young men. He followed each one of them with something
 of a fatherâ€™s eyes, and considered them all to be practically a success. And he was on friendly terms
 with them once they had left school. They would come to the old bachelor and have a chat, and relieve
 their minds of some difficulty or other. But it was always another matter with the confounded brood
 that sat upon the school benches for the time being; it resisted learning with might and main, and
 Fris prophesied it no good in the future. Fris hated the children. But he loved these squarely built
 hymns, which seemed to wear out the whole class, while he himself could give them without relaxing
 a muscle. And when it went as it was doing to-day, he could quite forget that there were such things
 as children, and give himself up to this endless procession, in which column after column filed past
 him, in the foot-fall of the rhythm. It was not hymns, either; it was a mighty march-past of the strong
 things of life, in which there stretched, in one endless tone, all that Fris himself had failed to
 attain. That was why he nodded so happily, and why the loud tramp of feet rose around him like the acclamations
 of armies, an _Ave CÃ¦sar_. He was sitting with the third supplement of his newspaper before him,
 but was not reading; his eyes were closed, and his head moved gently to the rhythm. The children babbled
 on ceaselessly, almost without stopping for breath; they were hypnotized by the monotonous flow
 of words. They were like the geese that had been given leave by the fox to say a prayer before they were
 eaten, and now went on praying and praying forever and ever. When they came to the end of the three hymns,
 they began again by themselves. The mill kept getting louder, they kept the time with their feet,
 and it was like the stroke of a mighty piston, a boom! Fris nodded with them, and a long tuft of hair flapped
 in his face; he fell into an ecstasy, and could not sit still upon his chair. â€œAnd were this world
 all devils oâ€™er, And watching to devourâ€”us, We lay it not to heart so sore; Not they can overpower
 us.â€ It sounded like a stamping-mill; some were beating their slates upon the tables, and others
 thumping with their elbows. Fris did not hear it; he heard only the mighty tramp of advancing hosts.
 â€œAnd let the prince of ill Look grim as eâ€™er he will,â€â€” Suddenly, at a preconcerted signal,
 the whole school stopped singing. Fris was brought to earth again with a shock. He opened his eyes,
 and saw that he had once more allowed himself to be taken by surprise. â€œYou little devils! You confounded
 brats!â€ he roared, diving into their midst with his cane. In a moment the whole school was in a tumult,
 the boys fighting and the girls screaming. Fris began hitting about him. He tried to bring them back
 to the patter. â€œWho puts his trust in God alone!â€ he shouted in a voice that drowned the clamor;
 but they did not take it upâ€”the little devils! Then he hit indiscriminately. He knew quite well
 that one was just as good as another, and was not particular where the strokes fell. He took the long-haired
 ones by the hair and dragged them to the table, and thrashed them until the cane began to split. The
 boys had been waiting for this; they had themselves rubbed onion into the cane that morning, and the
 most defiant of them had on several pairs of trousers for the occasion. When the cracked sound proclaimed
 that the cane was in process of disintegration, the whole school burst into deafening cheers. Fris
 had thrown up the game, and let them go on. He walked up and down the middle passage like a suffering
 animal, his gall rising. â€œYou little devils!â€ he hissed; â€œYou infernal brats!â€ And then,
 â€œDo sit still, children!â€ This last was so ridiculously touching in the midst of all the rest,
 that it had to be imitated. Pelle sat farthest away, in the corner. He was fairly new at this sort of
 thing, but did his best. Suddenly he jumped on to the table, and danced there in his stockinged feet.
 Fris gazed at him so strangely, Pelle thought; he was like Father Lasse when everything went wrong;
 and he slid down, ashamed. Nobody had noticed his action, however; it was far too ordinary. It was
 a deafening uproar, and now and then an ill-natured remark was hurled out of the seething tumult.
 Where they came from it was difficult to say; but every one of them hit Fris and made him cower. False
 steps made in his youth on the other side of the water fifty years ago, were brought up again here on
 the lips of these ignorant children, as well as some of his best actions, that had been so unselfish
 that the district put the very worst interpretation upon them. And as if that were not enoughâ€”but
 hush! He was sobbing. â€œShâ€”sh! Shâ€”sh!â€ It was Henry Bodker, the biggest boy in the school,
 and he was standing on a bench and shâ€”ing threateningly. The girls adored him, and became quiet
 directly; but some of the boys would not obey the order; but when Henry held his clenched fist up to
 one eye, they too became quiet. Fris walked up and down the middle passage like a pardoned offender.
 He did not dare to raise his eyes, but they could all see that he was crying. â€œItâ€™s a shame!â€ said
 a voice in an undertone. All eyes were turned upon him, and there was perfect silence in the room. â€œPlay-time!â€
 cried a boyâ€™s voice in a tone of command: it was Nilenâ€™s. Fris nodded feebly, and they rushed out.
 Fris remained behind to collect himself. He walked up and down with his hands behind his back, swallowing
 hard. He was going to send in his resignation. Every time things went quite wrong, Fris sent in his
 resignation, and when he had come to himself a little, he put it off until the spring examinations
 were over. He would not leave in this way, as a kind of failure. This very winter he had worked as he had
 never done before, in order that his resignation might have somewhat the effect of a bomb, and that
 they might really feel it as a loss when he had gone. When the examination was held, he would take the
 hymn-book for repetition in chorusâ€”right from the beginning. Some of the children would quickly
 drop behind, but there were some of them, into whom, in the course of time, he had hammered most of its
 contents. Long before they had run out, the clergyman would lift his hand to stop them, and say: â€œThatâ€™s
 enough, my dear clerk! Thatâ€™s enough!â€ and would thank him in a voice of emotion; while the school
 committee and the parents would whisper together in awed admiration. And then would be the time to
 resign! The school lay on the outskirts of the fishing-village, and the playground was the shore.
 When the boys were let out after a few hoursâ€™ lessons, they were like young cattle out for the first
 time after the long winter. They darted, like flitting swallows, in all directions, threw themselves
 upon the fresh rampart of sea-wrack and beat one another about the ears with the salt wet weeds. Pelle
 was not fond of this game; the sharp weed stung, and sometimes there were stones hanging to it, grown
 right in. But he dared not hold himself aloof, for that would attract attention at once. The thing
 was to join in it and yet not be in it, to make himself little and big according to the requirements of
 the moment, so as to be at one time unseen, and at another to exert a terrifying effect. He had his work
 cut out in twisting and turning, and slipping in and out. The girls always kept together in one corner
 of the playground, told tittle-tattle and ate their lunch, but the boys ran all over the place like
 swallows in aimless flight. A big boy was standing crouching close to the gymnastic apparatus, with
 his arm hiding his face, and munching. They whirled about him excitedly, now one and now another making
 the circle narrower and narrower. Peter Kofod â€”Howling Peterâ€”looked as if the world were sailing
 under him; he clung to the climbing-pole and hid his face. When they came close up to him, they kicked
 up behind with a roar, and the boy screamed with terror, turned up his face and broke into a long-drawn
 howl. Afterward he was given all the food that the others could not eat. Howling Peter was always eating
 and always howling. He was a pauper child and an orphan; he was big for his age, but had a strangely blue
 and frozen look. His frightened eyes stood half out of his head, and beneath them the flesh was swollen
 and puffy with crying. He started at the least sound, and there was always an expression of fear on
 his face. The boys never really did him any harm, but they screamed and crouched down whenever they
 passed himâ€”they could not resist it. Then he would scream too, and cower with fear. The girls would
 sometimes run up and tap him on the back, and then he screamed in terror. Afterward all the children
 gave him some of their food. He ate it all, roared, and was as famished as ever. No one could understand
 what was wrong with him. Twice he had made an attempt to hang himself, and nobody could give any reason
 for it, not even he himself. And yet he was not altogether stupid. Lasse believed that he was a visionary,
 and saw things that others could not see, so that the very fact of living and drawing breath frightened
 him. But however that might be, Pelle must on no account do anything to him, not for all the world. The
 crowd of boys had retired to the shore, and there, with little Nilen at their head, suddenly threw
 themselves upon Henry Bodker. He was knocked down and buried beneath the swarm, which lay in a sprawling
 heap upon the top of him, pounding down with clenched fists wherever there was an opening. But then
 a pair of fists began to push upward, tchew, tchew, like steam punches, the boys rolled off on all sides
 with their hands to their faces, and Henry Bodker emerged from the heap, kicking at random. Nilen
 was still hanging like a leech to the back of his neck, and Henry tore his blouse in getting him thrown
 off. To Pelle he seemed to be tremendously big as he stood there, only breathing a little quickly.
 And now the girls came up, and fastened his blouse together with pins, and gave him sweets; and he,
 by way of thanking them, seized them by their pigtails and tied them together, four or five of them,
 so that they could not get away from one another. They stood still and bore it patiently, only gazing
 at him with eyes of devotion. Pelle had ventured into the battle and had received a kick, but he bore
 no malice. If he had had a sweet, he, like the girls, would have given it to Henry Bodker, and would have
 put up with ungentle treatment too. He worshipped him. But he measured himself by Nilen â€”the little
 bloodthirsty Nilen, who had no knowledge of fear, and attacked so recklessly that the others got
 out of his way! He was always in the thickest of the crowd, jumped right into the worst of everything,
 and came safely out of it all. Pelle examined himself critically to find points of resemblance, and
 found themâ€”in his defence of Father Lasse the first summer, when he kicked a big boy, and in his relations
 with the mad bull, of which he was not in the least afraid. But in other points it failed. He was afraid
 of the dark, and he could not stand a thrashing, while Nilen could take his with his hands in his pockets.
 It was Pelleâ€™s first attempt at obtaining a general survey of himself. Fris had gone inland, probably
 to the church, so it would be a playtime of some hours. The boys began to look about for some more lasting
 ways of passing the time. The â€œbullsâ€ went into the schoolroom, and began to play about on the
 tables and benches, but the â€œblenniesâ€ kept to the shore. â€œBullsâ€ and â€œblenniesâ€ were
 the land and the sea in conflict; the division came naturally on every more or less serious occasion,
 and sometimes gave rise to regular battles. Pelle kept with the shore boys; Henry Bodker and Nilen
 were among them, and they were something new! They did not care about the land and animals, but the
 sea, of which he was afraid, was like a cradle to them. They played about on the water as they would in
 their motherâ€™s parlor, and had much of its easy movement. They were quicker than Pelle, but not
 so enduring; and they had a freer manner, and made less of the spot to which they belonged. They spoke
 of England in the most ordinary way and brought things to school that their fathers and brothers had
 brought home with them from the other side of the world, from Africa and China. They spent nights on
 the sea on an open boat, and when they played truant it was always to go fishing. The cleverest of them
 had their own fishing-tackle and little flat-bottomed prams, that they had built themselves and
 caulked with oakum. They fished on their own account and caught pike, eels, and tench, which they
 sold to the wealthier people in the district. Pelle thought he knew the stream thoroughly, but now
 he was brought to see it from a new side. Here were boys who in March and Aprilâ€”in the holidaysâ€”were
 up at three in the morning, wading barefoot at the mouth of the stream to catch the pike and perch that
 went up into the fresh water to spawn. And nobody told the boys to do it; they did it because they liked
 it! They had strange pleasures! Now they were standing â€œbefore the seaâ€ â€”in a long, jubilant
 row. They ran out with the receding wave to the larger stones out in the water, and then stood on the
 stones and jumped when the water came up again, like a flock of sea birds. The art consisted in keeping
 yourself dryshod, and yet it was the quickest boys who got wettest. There was of course a limit to the
 time you could keep yourself hovering. When wave followed wave in quick succession, you had to come
 down in the middle of it, and then sometimes it went over your head. Or an unusually large wave would
 come and catch all the legs as they were drawn up in the middle of the jump, when the whole row turned
 beautifully, and fell splash into the water. Then with, a deafening noise they went up to the schoolroom
 to turn the â€œbullsâ€ away from the stove. Farther along the shore, there were generally some boys
 sitting with a hammer and a large nail, boring holes in the stones there. They were sons of stone-masons
 from beyond the quarries. Pelleâ€™s cousin Anton was among them. When the holes were deep enough,
 powder was pressed into them, and the whole school was present at the explosion. In the morning, when
 they were waiting for the master, the big boys would stand up by the school wall with their hands in
 their pockets, discussing the amount of canvas and the home ports of vessels passing far out at sea.
 Pelle listened to them open-mouthed. It was always the sea and what belonged to the sea that they talked
 about, and most of it he did not understand. All these boys wanted the same thing when they were confirmedâ€”to
 go to sea. But Pelle had had enough of it when he crossed from Sweden; he could not understand them.
 How carefully he had always shut his eyes and put his fingers in his ears, so that his head should not
 get filled with water when he dived in the stream! But these boys swam down under the water like proper
 fish, and from what they said he understood that they could dive down in deep water and pick up stones
 from the bottom. â€œCan you see down there, then?â€ he asked, in wonder. â€œYes, of course! How else
 would the fish be able to keep away from the nets? If itâ€™s only moonlight, they keep far outside,
 the whole shoal!â€ â€œAnd the water doesnâ€™t run into your head when you take your fingers out of
 your ears?â€ â€œTake your fingers out of your ears?â€ â€œYes, to pick up the stone.â€ A burst of
 scornful laughter greeted this remark, and they began to question him craftily; he was splendidâ€”a
 regular country bumpkin! He had the funniest ideas about everything, and it very soon came out that
 he had never bathed in the sea. He was afraid of the water â€”a â€œblue-bagâ€; the stream could not
 do away with that. After that he was called Blue-bag, notwithstanding that he one day took the cattle-whip
 to school with him and showed them how he could cut three-cornered holes in a pair of trousers with
 the long lash, hit a small stone so that it disappeared into the air, and make those loud reports. It
 was all excellent, but the name stuck to him all the same; and all his little personality smarted under
 it. In the course of the winter, some strong young men came home to the village in blue clothes and white
 neck-cloths. They had laid up, as it was called, and some of them drew wages all through the winter
 without doing anything. They always came over to the school to see the master; they came in the middle
 of lessons, but it did not matter; Fris was joy personified. They generally brought something or
 other for himâ€”a cigar of such fine quality that it was enclosed in glass, or some other remarkable
 thing. And they talked to Fris as they would to a comrade, told him what they had gone through, so that
 the listening youngsters hugged themselves with delight, and quite unconcernedly smoked their
 clay pipes in the classâ€”with the bowl turned nonchalantly downward without losing its tobacco.
 They had been engaged as cookâ€™s boys and ordinary seamen, on the Spanish main and the Mediterranean
 and many other wonderful places. One of them had ridden up a fire-spouting mountain on a donkey. And
 they brought home with them lucifer matches that were as big, almost, as Pomeranian logs, and were
 to be struck on the teeth. The boys worshipped them and talked of nothing else; it was a great honor
 to be seen in the company of such a man. For Pelle it was not to be thought of. And then it came about that
 the village was awaiting the return of one such lad as this, and he did not come. And one day word came
 that bark so-and-so had gone to the bottom with all on board. It was the winter storms, said the boys,
 spitting like grown men. The brothers and sisters were kept away from school for a week, and when they
 came back Pelle eyed them curiously: it must be strange to have a brother lying at the bottom of the
 sea, quite young! â€œThen you wonâ€™t want to go to sea?â€ he asked them. Oh, yes, they wanted to go
 to sea, too! Another time Fris came back after an unusually long playtime in low spirits. He kept on
 blowing his nose hard, and now and then dried his eyes behind his spectacles. The boys nudged one another.
 He cleared his throat loudly, but could not make himself heard, and then beat a few strokes on his desk
 with the cane. â€œHave you heard, children?â€ he asked, when they had become more or less quiet.
 â€œNo! Yes! What?â€ they cried in chorus; and one boy said: â€œThat the sunâ€™s fallen into the sea
 and set it on fire!â€ The master quietly took up his hymn-book. â€œShall we sing â€˜How blessed are
 theyâ€™?â€ he said; and they knew that something must have happened, and sang the hymn seriously
 with him. But at the fifth verse Fris stopped; he could not go on any longer. â€œPeter Funck is drowned!â€
 he said, in a voice that broke on the last word. A horrified whisper passed through the class, and they
 looked at one another with uncomprehending eyes. Peter Funck was the most active boy in the village,
 the best swimmer, and the greatest scamp the school had ever hadâ€”and he was drowned! Fris walked
 up and down, struggling to control himself. The children dropped into softly whispered conversation
 about Peter Funck, and all their faces had grown old with gravity. â€œWhere did it happen?â€ asked
 a big boy. Fris awoke with a sigh. He had been thinking about this boy, who had shirked everything,
 and had then become the best sailor in the village; about all the thrashings he had given him, and the
 pleasant hours they had spent together on winter evenings when the lad was home from a voyage and had
 looked in to see his old master. There had been much to correct, and things of grave importance that
 Fris had had to patch up for the lad in all secrecy, so that they should not affect his whole life, andâ€”
 â€œIt was in the North Sea,â€ he said. â€œI think theyâ€™d been in England.â€ â€œTo Spain with dried
 fish,â€ said a boy. â€œAnd from there they went to England with oranges, and were bringing a cargo
 of coal home.â€ â€œYes, I think that was it,â€ said Fris. â€œThey were in the North Sea, and were
 surprised by a storm; and Peter had to go aloft.â€ â€œYes, for the _Trokkadej_ is such a crazy old
 hulk. As soon as thereâ€™s a little wind, they have to go aloft and take in sail,â€ said another boy.
 â€œAnd he fell down,â€ Fris went on, â€œand struck the rail and fell into the sea. There were the marks
 of his sea-boots on the rail. They bracedâ€”or whatever itâ€™s calledâ€”and managed to turn; but
 it took them half-an-hour to get up to the place. And just as they got there, he sank before their eyes.
 He had been struggling in the icy water for half-an-hourâ€”with sea-boots and oilskins onâ€”and
 yetâ€”â€ A long sigh passed through the class. â€œHe was the best swimmer on the whole shore!â€
 said Henry. â€œHe dived backward off the gunwale of a bark that was lying in the roads here taking in
 water, and came up on the other side of the vessel. He got ten rye rusks from the captain himself for
 it.â€ â€œHe must have suffered terribly,â€ said Fris. â€œIt would almost have been better for
 him if he hadnâ€™t been able to swim.â€ â€œThatâ€™s what my father says!â€ said a little boy. â€œHe
 canâ€™t swim, for he says itâ€™s better for a sailor not to be able to; it only keeps you in torture.â€
 â€œMy father canâ€™t swim, either!â€ exclaimed another. â€œNor mine, either!â€ said a third.
 â€œHe could easily learn, but he wonâ€™t.â€ And they went on in this way, holding up their hands.
 They could all swim themselves, but it appeared that hardly any of their fathers could; they had a
 superstitious feeling against it. â€œFather says you oughtnâ€™t to tempt Providence if youâ€™re
 wrecked,â€ one boy added. â€œWhy, but then youâ€™d not be doing your best!â€ objected a little
 faltering voice. Fris turned quickly toward the corner where Pelle sat blushing to the tips of his
 ears. â€œLook at that little man!â€ said Fris, impressed. â€œAnd I declare if he isnâ€™t right and
 all the rest of us wrong! God helps those that help themselves!â€ â€œPerhaps,â€ said a voice. It
 was Henry Bodkerâ€™s. â€œWell, well, I know He didnâ€™t help here, but still we ought always to do
 what we can in all the circumstances of life. Peter did his bestâ€”and he was the cleverest boy I ever
 had.â€ The children smiled at one another, remembering various things. Peter Funck had once gone
 so far as to wrestle with the master himself, but they had not the heart to bring this up. One of the bigger
 boys, however, said, half for the purpose of teasing: â€œHe never got any farther than the twenty-seventh
 hymn!â€ â€œDidnâ€™t he, indeed?â€ snarled Fris. â€œDidnâ€™t he, indeed? And you think perhaps
 youâ€™re clever, do you? Letâ€™s see how far youâ€™ve got, then!â€ And he took up the hymn-book with
 a trembling hand. He could not stand anything being said against boys that had left. The name Blue-bag
 continued to stick to Pelle, and nothing had ever stung him so much; and there was no chance of his getting
 rid of it before the summer came, and that was a long way off. One day the fisher-boys ran out on to the
 breakwater in playtime. A boat had just come in through the pack-ice with a gruesome cargo â€”five
 frozen men, one of whom was dead and lay in the fire-engine house, while the four others had been taken
 into various cottages, where they were being rubbed with ice to draw the frost out of them. The farmer-boys
 were allowed no share in all this excitement, for the fisher-boys, who went in and out and saw everything,
 drove them away if they approachedâ€”and sold meagre information at extortionate prices. The boat
 had met a Finnish schooner drifting in the sea, covered with ice, and with frozen rudder. She was too
 heavily laden, so that the waves went right over her and froze; and the ice had made her sink still deeper.
 When she was found, her deck was just on a level with the water, ropes of the thickness of a finger had
 become as thick as an arm with ice, and the men who were lashed to the rigging were shapeless masses
 of ice. They were like knights in armor with closed visor when they were taken down, and their clothes
 had to be hacked off their bodies. Three boats had gone out now to try and save the vessel; there would
 be a large sum of money to divide if they were successful. Pelle was determined not to be left out of
 all this, even if he got his shins kicked in, and so kept near and listened. The boys were talking gravely
 and looked gloomy. What those men had put up with! And perhaps their hands or feet would mortify and
 have to be cut off. Each boy behaved as if he were bearing his share of their sufferings, and they talked
 in a manly way and in gruff voices. â€œBe off with you, bull!â€ they called to Pelle. They were not
 fond of Blue-bags for the moment. The tears came to Pelleâ€™s eyes, but he would not give in, and wandered
 away along the wharf. â€œBe off with you!â€ they shouted again, picking up stones in a menacing way.
 â€œBe off to the other bumpkins, will you!â€ They came up and hit at him. â€œWhat are you standing
 there and staring into the water for? You might turn giddy and fall in head first! Be off to the other
 yokels, will you! Blue-bag!â€ Pelle turned literally giddy, with the strength of the determination
 that seized upon his little brain. â€œIâ€™m no more a blue-bag than you are!â€ he said. â€œWhy, you
 wouldnâ€™t even dare to jump into the water!â€ â€œJust listen to him! He thinks you jump into the
 water for fun in the middle of winter, and get cramp!â€ Pelle just heard their exultant laughter
 as he sprang off the breakwater, and the water, thick with ground-up ice, closed above his head. The
 top of his head appeared again, he made two or three strokes with his arms like a dog, and sank. The boys
 ran in confusion up and down and shouted, and one of them got hold of a boat-hook. Then Henry Bodker
 came running up, sprang in head first without stopping, and disappeared, while a piece of ice that
 he had struck with his forehead made ducks and drakes over the water. Twice his head appeared above
 the ice-filled water, to snatch a breath of air, and then he came up with Pelle. They got him hoisted
 up on to the breakwater, and Henry set to work to give him a good thrashing. Pelle had lost consciousness,
 but the thrashing had the effect of bringing him to. He suddenly opened his eyes, was on his legs in
 a trice, and darted away like a sandpiper. â€œRun home!â€ the boys roared after him. â€œRun as hard
 as ever you can, or youâ€™ll be ill! Only tell your father you fell in!â€ And Pelle ran. He needed no
 persuasion. When he reached Stone Farm, his clothes were frozen quite stiff, and his trousers could
 stand alone when he got out of them; but he himself was as warm as a toast. He would not lie to his father,
 but told him just what had happened. Lasse was angry, angrier than the boy had ever seen him before.
 Lasse knew how to treat a horse to keep it from catching cold, and began to rub Pelleâ€™s naked body
 with a wisp of straw, while the boy lay on the bed, tossing about under the rough handling. His father
 took no notice of his groans, but scolded him. â€œYou mad little devil, to jump straight into the sea
 in the middle of winter like a lovesick woman! You ought to have a whipping, thatâ€™s what you ought
 to haveâ€”a good sound whipping! But Iâ€™ll let you off this time if youâ€™ll go to sleep and try to
 sweat so that we can get that nasty salt water out of your body. I wonder if it wouldnâ€™t be a good thing
 to bleed you.â€ Pelle did not want to be bled; he was very comfortable lying there, now that he had
 been sick. But his thoughts were very serious. â€œSupposing Iâ€™d been drowned!â€ he said solemnly.
 â€œIf you had, Iâ€™d have thrashed you to within an inch of your life,â€ said Lasse angrily. Pelle
 laughed. â€œOh, you may laugh, you word-catcher!â€ snapped Lasse. â€œBut itâ€™s no joke being
 father to a little neâ€™er-do-weel of a cub like you!â€ Saying which he went angrily out into the
 stable. He kept on listening, however, and coming up to peep in and see whether fever or any other devilry
 had come of it. But Pelle slept quietly with his head under the quilt, and dreamed that he was no less
 a person than Henry Bodker. Pelle did not learn to read much that winter, but he learned twenty and
 odd hymns by heart only by using his ears, and he got the name Blue-bag, as applied to himself, completely
 banished. He had gained ground, and strengthened his position by several bold strokes; and the school
 began to take account of him as a brave boy. And Henry, who as a rule took no notice of anybody, took him
 several times under his wing. Now and then he had a bad conscience, especially when his father in his
 newly-awakened thirst for knowledge, came to him for the solution of some problem or other, and he
 was at a loss for an answer. â€œBut itâ€™s you who ought to have the learning,â€ Lasse would then say
 reproachfully. As the winter drew to an end, and the examination approached, Pelle became nervous.
 Many uncomfortable reports were current of the severity of the examination among the boysâ€”of
 putting into lower classes and complete dismissal from the school. Pelle had the misfortune not
 to be heard independently in a single hymn. He had to give an account of the Fall. The theft of the apple
 was easy to get through, but the curseâ€”! â€œAnd God said unto the serpent: Upon thy belly shalt thou
 go, upon thy belly shalt thou go, upon thy belly shalt thou go!â€ He could get no further. â€œDoes
 it still do that, then?â€ asked the clergyman kindly. â€œYesâ€”for it has no limbs.â€ â€œAnd can
 you explain to me what a limb is?â€ The priest was known to be the best examiner on the island; he could
 begin in a gutter and end in heaven, people said. â€œA limb isâ€”is a hand.â€ â€œYes, that is one.
 But canâ€™t you tell me something that distinguishes all limbs from other parts of the body? A limb
 isâ€”well?â€”a?â€”a part of the body that can move by itself, for instance? Well!â€ â€œThe ears!â€
 said Pelle, perhaps because his own were burning. â€œO-oh? Can you move your ears, then?â€ â€œYes.â€
 By dint of great perseverance, Pelle had acquired that art in the course of the previous summer, so
 as not to be outdone by Rud. â€œThen, upon my word, I should like to see it!â€ exclaimed the clergyman.
 So Pelle worked his ears industriously backward and forward, and the priest and the school committee
 and the parents all laughed. Pelle got â€œexcellentâ€ in religion. â€œSo it was your ears after
 all that saved you,â€ said Lasse, delighted. â€œDidnâ€™t I tell you to use your ears well? Highest
 marks in religion only for moving your ears! Why, I should think you might become a parson if you liked!â€
 And he went on for a long time. But wasnâ€™t he the devil of a laddie to be able to answer like that! XII
 â€œCome, cubby, cubby, cubby! Come on, you silly little chicken, thereâ€™s nothing to be afraid
 of!â€ Pelle was enticing his favorite calf with a wisp of green corn; but it was not quite sure of him
 to-day, for it had had a beating for bad behavior. Pelle felt very much like a father whose child gives
 him sorrow and compels him to use severe measures. And now this misunderstanding â€”that the calf
 would have nothing to do with him, although it was for its own good that he had beaten it! But there was
 no help for it, and as long as Pelle had them to mind, he intended to be obeyed. At last it let him come
 close up to it, so that he could stroke it. It stood still for a little and was sulky, but yielded at last,
 ate the green food and snuffed in his face by way of thanks. â€œWill you be good, then?â€ said Pelle,
 shaking it by its stumps of horns. â€œWill you, eh?â€ It tossed its head mischievously. â€œVery
 well, then you shanâ€™t carry my coat to-day.â€ The strange thing about this calf was that the first
 day it was let out, it would not stir, and at last the boy left it behind for Lasse to take in again. But
 no sooner was it behind him than it followed of its own accord, with its forehead close to his back;
 and always after that it walked behind him when they went out and came home, and it carried his overcoat
 on its back when it looked as if there would be rain. Pelleâ€™s years were few in number, but to his animals
 he was a grown man. Formerly he had only been able to make them respect him sufficiently to obey him
 at close quarters; but this year he could hit a cow at a distance of a hundred paces with a stone, and
 that gave him power over the animals at a distance, especially when he thought of calling out the animalâ€™s
 name as he hit it. In this way they realized that the pain came from him, and learned to obey the mere
 call. For punishment to be effectual, it must follow immediately upon the misdeed. There was therefore
 no longer any such thing as lying in wait for an animal that had offended, and coming up behind it when
 later on it was grazing peacefully. That only caused confusion. To run an animal until it was tired
 out, hanging on to its tail and beating it all round the meadow only to revenge oneâ€™s self, was also
 stupid; it made the whole flock restless and difficult to manage for the rest of the day. Pelle weighed
 the end and the means against one another; he learned to quench his thirst for revenge with good practical
 reasons. Pelle was a boy, and he was not an idle one. All day, from five in the morning until nine at night,
 he was busy with something or other, often most useless things. For hours he practiced walking on
 his hands, turning a somersault, and jumping the stream; he was always in motion. Hour after hour
 he would run unflaggingly round in a circle on the grass, like a tethered foal, leaning toward the
 center as he ran, so that his hand could pluck the grass, kicking up behind, and neighing and snorting.
 He was pouring forth energy from morning till night with open-handed profusion. But minding the
 cattle was _work_, and here he husbanded his energy. Every step that could be saved here was like capital
 acquired; and Pelle took careful notice of everything, and was always improving his methods. He
 learned that punishment worked best when it only hung as a threat; for much beating made an animal
 callous. He also learned to see when it was absolutely necessary to interfere. If this could not be
 done in the very act, he controlled himself and endeavored upon the strength of his experience to
 bring about exactly the same situation once more, and then to be prepared. The little fellow, unknown
 to himself, was always engaged in adding cubits unto his stature. He had obtained good results. The
 driving out and home again no longer gave him any difficulty; he had succeeded for a whole week in driving
 the flock along a narrow field road, with growing corn on both sides, without their having bitten
 off so much as a blade. And there was the still greater task of keeping them under control on a hot, close
 dayâ€”to hedge them in in full gallop, so that they stood in the middle of the meadow stamping on the
 ground with uplifted tails, in fear of the gad-flies. If he wanted to, he could make them tear home
 to the stable in wild flight, with their tails in the air, on the coldest October day, only by lying
 down in the grass and imitating the hum of gad-flies. But that was a tremendous secret, that even Father
 Lasse knew nothing about. The amusing thing about the buzzing was that calves that were out for the
 first time, and had never made the acquaintance of a gad-fly, instantly set off running, with tail
 erect, when they heard its angry buzz. Pelle had a remote ideal, which was to lie upon some elevated
 place and direct the whole flock by the sole means of his voice, and never need to resort to punishment.
 Father Lasse never beat either, no matter how wrong things went. There were some daysâ€”well, what
 did become of them? Before he had any idea of it, it was time to drive home. Other days were long enough,
 but seemed to sing themselves away, in the ring of scythes, the lowing of cattle, and peopleâ€™s voices
 far away. Then the day itself went singing over the ground, and Pelle had to stop every now and then
 to listen. Hark! there was music! And he would run up on to the sandbanks and gaze out over the sea; but
 it was not there, and inland there was no merrymaking that he knew of, and there were no birds of passage
 flying through the air at this time of year. But hark! there was music again! far away in the distance,
 just such a sound of music as reaches the ear from so far off that one cannot distinguish the melody,
 or say what instruments are playing. Could it be the sun itself? The song of light and life streamed
 through him, as though he were a fountain; and he would go about in a dreamy half-consciousness of
 melody and happiness. When the rain poured down, he hung his coat over a briar and lay sheltered beneath
 it, carving or drawing with a lead button on paperâ€”horses, and bulls lying down, but more often
 ships, ships that sailed across the sea upon their own soft melody, far away to foreign lands, to Negroland
 and China, for rare things. And when he was quite in the mood, he would bring out a broken knife and a
 piece of shale from a secret hiding-place, and set to work. There was a picture scratched on the stone,
 and he was now busy carving it in relief. He had worked at it on and off all through the summer, and now
 it was beginning to stand out. It was a bark in full sail, sailing over rippling water to Spainâ€”yes,
 it was going to Spain, for grapes and oranges, and all the other delightful things that Pelle had never
 tasted yet. On rainy days it was a difficult matter to keep count of the time, and required the utmost
 exertion. On other days it was easy enough, and Pelle could tell it best by the feeling. At certain
 times of the day there were signs at home on the farm that told him the time, and the cattle gave him other
 hours by their habits. At nine the first one lay down to chew the morning cud, and then all gradually
 lay down one by one; and there was always a moment at about ten when they all lay chewing. At eleven the
 last of them were upon their legs again. It was the same in the afternoon between three and five. Midday
 was easy to determine when the sun was shining. Pelle could always feel it when it turned in its path.
 And there were a hundred other things in nature that gave him a connection with the times of day, such
 as the habits of the birds, and something about the fir-trees, and much besides that he could not lay
 his finger upon and say it was there, because it was only a feeling. The time to drive home was given
 by the cattle themselves. When it drew near, they grazed slowly around until their heads pointed
 in the direction of the farm; and there was a visible tension in their bodies, a homeward yearning.
 Rud had not shown himself all the week, and no sooner had he come today than Pelle had to give him a blowing-up
 for some deceitfulness. Then he ran home, and Pelle lay down at the edge of the fir-plantation, on
 his face with the soles of his feet in the air, and sang. All round him there were marks of his knife on
 the tree-stems. On the earliest ships you saw the keel, the deck was perpendicular to the body. Those
 had been carved the first summer. There was also a collection of tiny fields here on the edge of the
 stream, properly ploughed, harrowed, and sown, each field about two feet square. Pelle was resting
 now after the exertion with Rud, by making the air rock with his jubilant bawling. Up at the farm a man
 came out and went along the high-road with a bundle under his arm. It was Erik, who had to appear in court
 in answer to a summons for fighting. Then the farmer drove out at a good pace toward the town, so he was
 evidently off on the spree. Why couldnâ€™t the man have driven with him, as they were both going the
 same way? How quickly he drove, although she never followed him now. She consoled herself at home
 instead! Could it be true that he had spent five hundred krones in drinking and amusement in one evening?
 â€œThe war is raging, the red blood streams, Among the mountains ring shouts and screams! The Turk
 advances with cruel rage, And sparing neither youth nor age. They goâ€”â€ â€œHo!â€ Pelle sprang
 to his feet and gazed up over the clover field. The dairy cows up there for the last quarter of an hour
 had been looking up at the farm every other moment, and now Aspasia lowed, so his father must soon be
 coming out to move them. There he came, waddling round the corner of the farm. It was not far to the lowest
 of the cows, so when his father was there, Pelle could seize the opportunity just to run across and
 say good-day to him. He brought his animals nearer together and drove them slowly over to the other
 fence and up the fields. Lasse had moved the upper half, and was now crossing over diagonally to the
 bull, which stood a little apart from the others. The bull was growling and kicking up the earth; its
 tongue hung out at one side of its mouth, and it tossed its head quickly; it was angry. Then it advanced
 with short steps and all kinds of antics; and how it stamped! Pelle felt a desire to kick it on the nose
 as he had often done before; it had no business to threaten Lasse, even if it meant nothing by it. Father
 Lasse took no notice of it, either. He stood hammering away at the big tether-peg, to loosen it. â€œGood-day!â€
 shouted Pelle. Lasse turned his head and nodded, then bent down and hammered the peg into the ground.
 The bull was just behind him, stamping quickly, with open mouth and tongue hanging out; it looked
 as if it were vomiting, and the sound it made answered exactly to that. Pelle laughed as he slackened
 his pace. He was close by. But suddenly Father Lasse turned a somersault, fell, and was in the air again,
 and then fell a little way off. Again the bull was about to toss him, but Pelle was at its head. He was
 not wearing wooden shoes, but he kicked it with his bare feet until he was giddy. The bull knew him and
 tried to go round him, but Pelle sprang at its head, shouting and kicking and almost beside himself,
 seized it by the horns. But it put him gently on one side and went forward toward Lasse, blowing along
 the ground so that the grass waved. It took hold of him by the blouse and shook him a little, and then
 tried to get both his horns under him to send him up into the air; but Pelle was on his feet again, and
 as quick as lightning had drawn his knife and plunged it in between the bullâ€™s hind legs. The bull
 uttered a short roar, turned Lasse over on one side, and dashed off over the fields at a gallop, tossing
 its head as it ran, and bellowing. Down by the stream it began to tear up the bank, filling the air with
 earth and grass. Lasse lay groaning with his eyes closed, and Pelle stood pulling in vain at his arm
 to help him up, crying: â€œFather, little Father Lasse!â€ At last Lasse sat up. â€œWhoâ€™s that
 singing?â€ he asked. â€œOh, itâ€™s you, is it, laddie? And youâ€™re crying! Has any one done anything
 to you? Ah, yes, of course, it was the bull! It was just going to play fandango with me. But what did you
 do to it, that the devil took it so quickly? You saved your fatherâ€™s life, little though you are.
 Oh, hang it! I think Iâ€™m going to be sick! Ah me!â€ he went on, when the sickness was past, as he wiped
 the perspiration from his forehead. â€œIf only I could have had a dram. Oh, yes, he knew me, the fellow,
 or I shouldnâ€™t have got off so easily. He only wanted to play with me a little, you know. He was a wee
 bit spiteful because I drove him away from a cow this morning; Iâ€™d noticed that. But whoâ€™d have
 thought heâ€™d have turned on me? He wouldnâ€™t have done so, either, if I hadnâ€™t been so silly as
 to wear somebody elseâ€™s clothes. This is Monsâ€™s blouse; I borrowed it of him while I washed my
 own. And Mr. Bull didnâ€™t like the strange smell about me. Well, weâ€™ll see what Monsâ€™ll say to
 this here slit. Iâ€™m afraid he wonâ€™t be best pleased.â€ Lasse talked on for a good while until
 he tried to rise, and stood up with Pelleâ€™s assistance. As he stood leaning on the boyâ€™s shoulder,
 he swayed backward and forward. â€œI should almost have said I was drunk, if it hadnâ€™t been for the
 pains!â€ he said, laughing feebly. â€œWell, well, I suppose I must thank God for you, laddie. You
 always gladden my heart, and now youâ€™ve saved my life, too.â€ Lasse then stumbled homeward, and
 Pelle moved the rest of the cows on the road down to join his own. He was both proud and affected, but
 most proud. He had saved Father Lasseâ€™s life, and from the big, angry bull that no one else on the
 farm dared have anything to do with. The next time Henry Bodker came out to see him, he should hear all
 about it. He was a little vexed with himself for having drawn his knife. Every one here looked down
 upon that, and said it was Swedish. He wouldnâ€™t have needed to do it either if thereâ€™d been time,
 or if only he had had on his wooden shoes to kick the bull in the eyes with. He had very often gone at it
 with the toes of his wooden shoes, when it had to be driven into its stall again after a covering; and
 it always took good care not to do anything to him. Perhaps he would put his finger in its eye and make
 it blind, or take it by the horns and twist its head round, like the man in the story, until its neck was
 wrung. Pelle grew and swelled up until he overshadowed everything. There was no limit to his strength
 while he ran about bringing his animals together again. He passed like a storm over everything, tossed
 strong Erik and the bailiff about, and liftedâ€”yes, lifted the whole of Stone Farm merely by putting
 his hand under the beam. It was quite a fit of berserker rage! In the very middle of it all, it occurred
 to him how awkward it would be if the bailiff got to know that the bull was loose. It might mean a thrashing
 both for him and Lasse. He must go and look for it; and for safetyâ€™s sake he took his long whip with
 him and put on his wooden shoes. The bull had made a terrible mess down on the bank of the stream, and
 had ploughed up a good piece of the meadow. It had left bloody traces along the bed of the stream and
 across the fields. Pelle followed these out toward the headland, where he found the bull. The huge
 animal had gone right in under the bushes, and was standing licking its wound. When it heard Pelleâ€™s
 voice, it came out. â€œTurn round!â€ he cried, flicking its nose with the whip. It put its head to
 the ground, bellowed, and moved heavily backward. Pelle continued flicking it on the nose while
 he advanced step by step, shouting determinedly: â€œTurn round! Will you turn round!â€ At last
 it turned and set off at a run, Pelle seizing the tether-peg and running after. He kept it going with
 the whip, so that it should have no time for evil thoughts. When this was accomplished, he was ready
 to drop with fatigue, and lay crouched up at the edge of the fir-plantation, thinking sadly of Father
 Lasse, who must be going about up there ill and with nobody to give him a helping hand with his work.
 At last the situation became unbearable: he had to go home! _Zzzz! Zzzz!_ Lying flat on the ground,
 Pelle crept over the grass, imitating the maddening buzz of the gad-fly. He forced the sound out between
 his teeth, rising and falling, as if it were flying hither and thither over the grass. The cattle stopped
 grazing and stood perfectly still with attentive ears. Then they began to grow nervous, kicking
 up their legs under their bodies, turning their heads to one side in little curves, and starting;
 and then up went their tails. He made the sound more persistently angry, and the whole flock, infecting
 one another, turned and began to stamp round in wild panic. Two calves broke out of the tumult, and
 made a bee-line for the farm, and the whole flock followed, over stock and stone. All Pelle had to do
 now was to run after them, making plenty of fuss, and craftily keep the buzzing going, so that the mood
 should last till they reached home. The bailiff himself came running to open the gate into the enclosure,
 and helped to get the animals in. Pelle expected a box on the ears, and stood still; but the bailiff
 only looked at him with a peculiar smile, and said: â€œTheyâ€™re beginning to get the upper hand of
 you, I think. Well, well,â€ he went on, â€œitâ€™s all right as long as you can manage the bull!â€
 He was making fun of him, and Pelle blushed up to the roots of his hair. Father Lasse had crept into bed.
 â€œWhat a good thing you came!â€ he said. â€œI was just lying here and wondering how I was going to
 get the cows moved. I can scarcely move at all, much less get up.â€ It was a week before Lasse was on
 his feet again, and during that time the field-cattle remained in the enclosure, and Pelle stayed
 at home and did his fatherâ€™s work. He had his meals with the others, and slept his midday sleep in
 the barn as they did. One day, in the middle of the day, the Sow came into the yard, drunk. She took her
 stand in the upper yard, where she was forbidden to go, and stood there calling for Kongstrup. The
 farmer was at home, but did not show himself, and not a soul was to be seen behind the high windows. â€œKongstrup,
 Kongstrup! Come here for a little!â€ she called, with her eyes on the pavement, for she could not
 lift her head. The bailiff was not at home, and the men remained in hiding in the barn, hoping to see
 some fun. â€œI say, Kongstrup, come out a moment! I want to speak to you!â€ said the Sow indistinctlyâ€”and
 then went up the steps and tried to open the door. She hammered upon it a few times, and stood talking
 with her face close to the door; and when nobody came, she reeled down the steps and went away talking
 to herself and not looking round. A little while after the sound of weeping began up there, and just
 as the men were going out to the fields, the farmer came rushing out and gave orders that the horse should
 be harnessed to the chaise. While it was being done, he walked about nervously, and then set off at
 full speed. As he turned the corner of the house, a window opened and a voice called to him imploringly:
 â€œKongstrup, Kongstrup!â€ But he drove quickly on, the window closed, and the weeping began afresh.
 In the afternoon Pelle was busying himself about the lower yard when Karna came to him and told him
 to go up to mistress. Pelle went up hesitatingly. He was not sure of her and all the men were out in the
 fields. Fru Kongstrup lay upon the sofa in her husbandâ€™s study, which she always occupied, day
 or night, when her husband was out. She had a wet towel over her forehead, and her whole face was red
 with weeping. â€œCome here!â€ she said, in a low voice. â€œYou arenâ€™t afraid of me, are you?â€
 Pelle had to go up to her and sit on the chair beside her. He did not know what to do with his eyes; and his
 nose began to run with the excitement, and he had no pocket-handkerchief. â€œAre you afraid of me?â€
 she asked again, and a bitter smile crossed her lips. He had to look at her to show that he was not afraid,
 and to tell the truth, she was not like a witch at all, but only like a human being who cried and was unhappy.
 â€œCome here!â€ she said, and she wiped his nose with her own fine handkerchief, and stroked his
 hair. â€œYou havenâ€™t even a mother, poor little thing!â€ And she smoothed down his clumsily mended
 blouse. â€œItâ€™s three years now since Mother Bengta died, and sheâ€™s lying in the west corner
 of the churchyard.â€ â€œDo you miss her very much?â€ â€œOh, well, Father Lasse mends my clothes!â€
 â€œIâ€™m sure she canâ€™t have been very good to you.â€ â€œOh, yes!â€ said Pelle, nodding earnestly.
 â€œBut she was so fretful, she was always ailing; and itâ€™s better they should go when they get like
 that. But now weâ€™re soon going to get married againâ€”when Father Lasseâ€™s found somebody thatâ€™ll
 do.â€ â€œAnd then I suppose youâ€™ll go away from here? Iâ€™m sure you arenâ€™t comfortable here,
 are you?â€ Pelle had found his tongue, but now feared a trap, and became dumb. He only nodded. Nobody
 should come and accuse him afterward of having complained. â€œNo, you arenâ€™t comfortable,â€
 she said, in a plaintive tone. â€œNo one is comfortable at Stone Farm. Everything turns to misfortune
 here.â€ â€œItâ€™s an old curse, that!â€ said Pelle. â€œDo they say so? Yes, yes, I know they do!
 And they say of me that Iâ€™m a devilâ€”only because I love a single manâ€”and cannot put up with being
 trampled on.â€ She wept and pressed his hand against her quivering face. â€œIâ€™ve got to go out
 and move the cows,â€ said Pelle, wriggling about uneasily in an endeavor to get away. â€œNow youâ€™re
 afraid of me again!â€ she said, and tried to smile. It was like a gleam of sunshine after rain. â€œNoâ€”only
 Iâ€™ve got to go out and move the cows.â€ â€œThereâ€™s still a whole hour before that. But why arenâ€™t
 you herding to-day? Is your father ill?â€ Then Pelle had to tell her about the bull. â€œYouâ€™re
 a good boy!â€ said the mistress, patting his head. â€œIf I had a son, I should like him to be like you.
 But now you shall have some jam, and then you must run to the shop for a bottle of black-currant rum,
 so that we can make a hot drink for your father. If you hurry, you can be back before moving-time.â€
 Lasse had his hot drink, even before the boy returned; and every day while he kept his bed he had something
 strengtheningâ€”although there was no black-currant rum in it. During this time Pelle went up to
 the mistress nearly every day. Kongstrup had gone on business to Copenhagen. She was kind to him and
 gave him nice things to eat; and while he ate, she talked without ceasing about Kongstrup, or asked
 him what people thought about her. Pelle had to tell her, and then she was upset and began to cry. There
 was no end to her talk about the farmer, but she contradicted herself, and Pelle gave up trying to make
 anything of it. Besides, the good things she gave him were quite enough for him to think about. Down
 in their room he repeated everything word for word, and Lasse lay and listened, and wondered at this
 little fellow who had the run of high places, and was in the mistressâ€™s confidence. Still he did
 not quite like it. â€œâ€¦ She could scarcely stand, and had to hold on to the table when she was going
 to fetch me the biscuits, she was so ill. It was only because heâ€™d treated her badly, she said. Do
 you know she hates him, and would like to kill him, she says; and yet she says that heâ€™s the handsomest
 man in the world, and asked me if Iâ€™ve seen any one handsomer in all Sweden. And then she cries as if
 she was mad.â€ â€œDoes she?â€ said Lasse thoughtfully. â€œI donâ€™t suppose she knows what sheâ€™s
 saying, or else she says it for reasons of her own. But all the same, itâ€™s not true that he beats her!
 Sheâ€™s telling a lie, Iâ€™m sure.â€ â€œAnd why should she lie?â€ â€œBecause she wants to do him
 harm, I suppose. But itâ€™s true heâ€™s a fine manâ€”and cares for everybody except just her; and
 thatâ€™s the misfortune. I donâ€™t like your being so much up there; Iâ€™m so afraid you may come to
 some harm.â€ â€œHow could I? Sheâ€™s so good, so very good.â€ â€œHow am I to know that? No, she isnâ€™t
 goodâ€”her eyes arenâ€™t good, at any rate. Sheâ€™s brought more than one person into misfortune
 by looking at them. But thereâ€™s nothing to be done about it; the poor man has to risk things.â€ Lasse
 was silent, and stumbled about for a little while. Then he came up to Pelle. â€œNow, see here! Hereâ€™s
 a piece of steel Iâ€™ve found, and you must remember always to have it about you, especially when you
 go up _there_! And thenâ€”yes, then we must leave the rest in Godâ€™s hand. Heâ€™s the only one who
 perhaps looks after poor little boys.â€ Lasse was up for a short while that day. He was getting on
 quickly, thank God, and in two days they might be back in their old ways again. And next winter they
 must try to get away from it all! On the last day that Pelle stayed at home, he went up to the mistress
 as usual, and ran her errand for her. And that day he saw something unpleasant that made him glad that
 this was over. She took her teeth, palate, and everything out of her mouth, and laid them on the table
 in front of her! So she _was_ a witch! XIII Pelle was coming home with his young cattle. As he came near
 the farm he issued his commands in a loud voice, so that his father might hear. â€œHi! Spasianna! where
 are you going to? Dannebrog, you confounded old ram, will you turn round!â€ But Lasse did not come
 to open the gate of the enclosure. When he had got the animals in, he ran into the cow-stable. His father
 was neither there nor in their room, and his Sunday wooden shoes and his woollen cap were gone. Then
 Pelle remembered that it was Saturday, and that probably the old man had gone to the shop to fetch spirits
 for the men. Pelle went down into the servantsâ€™ room to get his supper. The men had come home late,
 and were still sitting at the table, which was covered with spilt milk and potato-skins. They were
 engrossed in a wager; Erik undertook to eat twenty salt herrings with potatoes after he had finished
 his meal. The stakes were a bottle of spirits, and the others were to peel the potatoes for him. Pelle
 got out his pocket-knife and peeled himself a pile of potatoes. He left the skin on the herring, but
 scraped it carefully and cut off the head and tail; then he cut it in pieces and ate it without taking
 out the bones, with the potatoes and the sauce. While he did so, he looked at Erikâ€”the giant Erik,
 who was so strong and was not afraid of anything between heaven and earth. Erik had children all over
 the place! Erik could put his finger into the barrel of a gun, and hold the gun straight out at armâ€™s
 length! Erik could drink as much as three others! And now Erik was sitting and eating twenty salt herrings
 after his hunger was satisfied. He took the herring by the head, drew it once between his legs, and
 then ate it as it was; and he ate potatoes to them, quite as quickly as the others could peel them. In
 between whiles he swore because the bailiff had refused him permission to go out that evening; there
 was going to be the devil to pay about that: heâ€™d teach them to keep Erik at home when he wanted to go
 out! Pelle quickly swallowed his herring and porridge, and set off again to run to meet his father;
 he was longing immensely to see him. Out at the pump the girls were busy scouring the milkpails and
 kitchen pans; and Gustav was standing in the lower yard with his arms on the fence, talking to them.
 He was really watching Bodil, whose eyes were always following the new pupil, who was strutting up
 and down and showing off his long boots with patent-leather tops. Pelle was stopped as he ran past,
 and set to pump water. The men now came up and went across to the barn, perhaps to try their strength.
 Since Erik had come, they always tried their strength in their free time. There was nothing Pelle
 found so exciting as trials of strength, and he worked hard so as to get done and go over there. Gustav,
 who was generally the most eager, continued to stand and vent his ill-nature upon the pupil. â€œThere
 must be money there!â€ said Bodil, thoughtfully. â€œYes, you should try him; perhaps you might
 become a farmerâ€™s wife. The bailiff wonâ€™t anyhow; and the farmerâ€”well, you saw the Sow the
 other day; it must be nice to have that in prospect.â€ â€œWho told you that the bailiff wonâ€™t?â€
 answered Bodil sharply. â€œDonâ€™t imagine that we need you to hold the candle for us! Little children
 arenâ€™t allowed to see everything.â€ Gustav turned red. â€œOh, hold your jaw, you hussy!â€ he
 muttered, and sauntered down to the barn. â€œOh, goodness gracious, my poor old mother, Whoâ€™s
 up on deck and canâ€™t stand!â€ sang Mons over at the stable door, where he was standing hammering
 at a cracked wooden shoe. Pelle and the girls were quarreling, and up in the attic the bailiff could
 be heard going about; he was busy putting pipes in order. Now and then a long-drawn sound came from
 the high house, like the distant howling of some animal, making the people shudder with dreariness.
 A man dressed in his best clothes, and with a bundle under his arm, slipped out of the door from the menâ€™s
 rooms, and crept along by the building in the lower yard. It was Erik. â€œHi, there! Where the devil
 are you going?â€ thundered a voice from the bailiffâ€™s window. The man ducked his head a little
 and pretended not to hear. â€œDo you hear, you confounded Kabyle! _Erik_!â€ This time Erik turned
 and darted in at a barn-door. Directly after the bailiff came down and went across the yard. In the
 chaff-cutting barn the men were standing laughing at Erikâ€™s bad luck. â€œHeâ€™s a devil for keeping
 watch!â€ said Gustav. â€œYou must be up early to get the better of _him_.â€ â€œOh, Iâ€™ll manage
 to dish him!â€ said Erik. â€œI wasnâ€™t born yesterday. And if he doesnâ€™t mind his own business,
 we shall come to blows.â€ There was a sudden silence as the bailiffâ€™s well-known step was heard
 upon the stone paving. Erik stole away. The form of the bailiff filled the doorway. â€œWho sent Lasse
 for gin?â€ he asked sternly. They looked at one another as if not understanding. â€œIs Lasse out?â€
 asked Mons then, with the most innocent look in the world. â€œAy, the old manâ€™s fond of spirits,â€
 said Anders, in explanation. â€œOh, yes; youâ€™re good comrades!â€ said the bailiff. â€œFirst
 you make the old man go, and then you leave him in the lurch. You deserve a thrashing, all of you.â€
 â€œNo, we donâ€™t deserve a thrashing, and donâ€™t mean to submit to one either,â€ said the head
 man, going a step forward. â€œLet me tell youâ€”â€ â€œHold your tongue, man!â€ cried the bailiff,
 going close up to him, and Karl Johan drew back. â€œWhereâ€™s Erik?â€ â€œHe must be in his room.â€
 The bailiff went in through the horse-stable, something in his carriage showing that he was not altogether
 unprepared for an attack from behind. Erik was in bed, with the quilt drawn up to his eyes. â€œWhatâ€™s
 the meaning of this? Are you ill?â€ asked the bailiff. â€œYes, I think Iâ€™ve caught cold, Iâ€™m
 shivering so.â€ He tried to make his teeth chatter. â€œIt isnâ€™t the rot, I hope?â€ said the bailiff
 sympathetically. â€œLetâ€™s look at you a little, poor fellow.â€ He whipped off the quilt. â€œOho,
 so youâ€™re in bed with your best things onâ€”and top-boots! Itâ€™s your grave-clothes, perhaps?
 And I suppose you were going out to order a pauperâ€™s grave for yourself, werenâ€™t you? Itâ€™s time
 we got you put underground, too; seems to me youâ€™re beginning to smell already!â€ He sniffed at
 him once or twice. But Erik sprang out of bed as if shot by a spring, and stood erect close to him. â€œIâ€™m
 not dead yet, and perhaps I donâ€™t smell any more than some other people!â€ he said, his eyes flashing
 and looking about for a weapon. The bailiff felt his hot breath upon his face, and knew it would not
 do to draw back. He planted his fist in the manâ€™s stomach, so that he fell back upon the bed and gasped
 for breath; and then held him down with a hand upon his chest. He was burning with a desire to do more,
 to drive his fist into the face of this rascal, who grumbled whenever oneâ€™s back was turned, and
 had to be driven to every little task. Here was all the servant-worry that embittered his existence
 â€”dissatisfaction with the fare, cantankerousness in work, threats of leaving when things were
 at their busiestâ€”difficulties without end. Here was the slave of many years of worry and ignominy,
 and all he wanted was one little pretextâ€”a blow from this big fellow who never used his strength
 for work, but only to take the lead in all disturbances. But Erik lay quite still and looked at his enemy
 with watchful eye. â€œYou may hit me, if you like. There is such a thing as a magistrate in the country,â€
 he said, with irritating calm. The bailiffâ€™s muscles burned, but he was obliged to let the man go
 for fear of being summoned. â€œThen remember another time not to be fractious!â€ he said, letting
 go his hold, â€œor Iâ€™ll show you that there is a magistrate.â€ â€œWhen Lasse comes, send him up
 to me with the gin!â€ he said to the men as he passed through the barn. â€œThe devil we will!â€ said
 Mons, in an undertone. Pelle had gone to meet his father. The old man had tasted the purchase, and was
 in good spirits. â€œThere were seven men in the boat, and they were all called Ole except one, and he
 was called Ole Olsen!â€ he said solemnly, when he saw the boy. â€œYes, wasnâ€™t it a strange thing,
 Pelle, boy, that they should every one of them be called Oleâ€”except the one, of course; for his name
 was Ole Olsen.â€ Then he laughed, and nudged the boy mysteriously; and Pelle laughed too, for he
 liked to see his father in good spirits. The men came up to them, and took the bottles from the herdsman.
 â€œHeâ€™s been tasting it!â€ said Anders, holding the bottle up to the light. â€œOh, the old drunkard!
 Heâ€™s had a taste at the bottles.â€ â€œNo, the bottles must leak at the bottom!â€ said Lasse, whom
 the dram had made quite bold. â€œFor Iâ€™ve done nothing but just smell. Youâ€™ve got to make sure,
 you know, that you get the genuine thing and not just water.â€ They moved on down the enclosure, Gustav
 going in front and playing on his concertina. A kind of excited merriment reigned over the party.
 First one and then another would leap into the air as they went; they uttered short, shrill cries and
 disconnected oaths at random. The consciousness of the full bottles, Saturday evening with the
 day of rest in prospect, and above all the row with the bailiff, had roused their tempers. They settled
 down below the cow-stable, in the grass close to the pond. The sun had long since gone down, but the
 evening sky was bright, and cast a flaming light upon their faces turned westward; while the white
 farms inland looked dazzling in the twilight. Now the girls came sauntering over the grass, with
 their hands under their aprons, looking like silhouettes against the brilliant sky. They were humming
 a soft folk-song, and one by one sank on to the grass beside the men; the evening twilight was in their
 hearts, and made their figures and voices as soft as a caress. But the menâ€™s mood was not a gentle
 one, and they preferred the bottle. Gustav walked about extemporizing on his concertina. He was
 looking for a place to sit down, and at last threw himself into Karnaâ€™s lap, and began to play a dance.
 Erik was the first upon his feet. He led on account of his difference with the bailiff, and pulled Bengta
 up from the grass with a jerk. They danced a Swedish polka, and always at a certain place in the melody,
 he tossed her up into the air with a shout. She shrieked every time, and her heavy skirts stood out round
 her like the tail of a turkey-cock, so that every one could see how long it was till Sunday. In the middle
 of a whirl he let go of her, so that she stumbled over the grass and fell. The bailiffâ€™s window was
 visible from where they sat, and a light patch had appeared at it. â€œHeâ€™s staring! Lord, how heâ€™s
 staring! I say, can you see this?â€ Erik called out, holding up a gin-bottle. Then, as he drank: â€œYour
 health! Old Nickâ€™s health! He smells, the pig! Bah!â€ The others laughed, and the face at the window
 disappeared. In between the dances they played, drank, and wrestled. Their actions became more
 and more wild, they uttered sudden yells that made the girls scream, threw themselves flat upon the
 ground in the middle of a dance, groaned as if they were dying, and sprang up again suddenly with wild
 gestures and kicked the legs of those nearest to them. Once or twice the bailiff sent the pupil to tell
 them to be quiet, but that only made the noise worse. â€œTell him to go his own dogâ€™s errands!â€
 Erik shouted after the pupil. Lasse nudged Pelle and they gradually drew farther and farther away.
 â€œWeâ€™d better go to bed now,â€ Lasse said, when they had slipped away unnoticed. â€œOne never
 knows what this may lead to. They all of them see red; I should think theyâ€™ll soon begin to dance the
 dance of blood. Ah me, if Iâ€™d been young I wouldnâ€™t have stolen away like a thief; Iâ€™d have stayed
 and taken whatever might have come. There was a time when Lasse could put both hands on the ground and
 kick his man in the face with the heels of his boots so that he went down like a blade of grass; but that
 timeâ€™s gone, and itâ€™s wisest to take care of oneâ€™s self. This may end in the police and much more,
 not to mention the bailiff. Theyâ€™ve been irritating him all the summer with that Erik at their head;
 but if once he gets downright angry, Erik may go home to his mother.â€ Pelle wanted to stay up for a
 little and look at them. â€œIf I creep along behind the fence and lie downâ€”oh, do let me, father!â€
 he begged. â€œEh, what a silly idea! They might treat you badly if they got hold of you. Theyâ€™re in
 the very worst of moods. Well, you must take the consequences, and for goodnessâ€™ sake take care
 they donâ€™t see you!â€ So Lasse went to bed, but Pelle crawled along on the ground behind the fence
 until he came close up to them and could see everything. Gustav was still sitting on Karnaâ€™s open
 lap and playing, and she was holding him fast in her arms. But Anders had put his arm around Bodilâ€™s
 waist. Gustav discovered it, and with an oath flung away his concertina, sending it rolling over
 the grass, and sprang up. The others threw themselves down in a circle on the grass, breathing hard.
 They expected something. Gustav was like a savage dancing a war-dance. His mouth was open and his
 eyes bright and staring. He was the only man on the grass, and jumped up and down like a ball, hopped
 upon his heels, and kicked up his legs alternately to the height of his head, uttering a shrill cry
 with each kick. Then he shot up into the air, turning round as he did so, and came down on one heel and
 went on turning round like a top, making himself smaller and smaller as he turned, and then exploded
 in a leap and landed in the lap of Bodil, who threw her arms about him in delight. In an instant Anders
 had both hands on his shoulders from behind, set his feet against his back, and sent him rolling over
 the grass. It all happened without a pause, and Gustav himself gave impetus to his course, rolling
 along in jolts like an uneven ball. But suddenly he stopped and rose to his feet with a bound, stared
 straight in front of him, turned round with a jerk, and moved slowly toward Anders. Anders rose quickly,
 pushed his cap on one side, clicked with his tongue, and advanced. Bodil spread herself out more comfortably
 on the ground, and looked proudly round the circle, eagerly noting the envy of the others. The two
 antagonists stood face to face, feeling their way to a good grasp. They stroked one another affectionately,
 pinched one another in the side, and made little jesting remarks. â€œMy goodness me, how fat you are,
 brother!â€ This was Anders. â€œAnd what breasts youâ€™ve got! You might quite well be a woman,â€
 answered Gustav, feeling Andersâ€™ chest. â€œEeh, how soft you are!â€ Scorn gleamed in their faces,
 but their eyes followed every movement of their opponent. Each of them expected a sudden attack from
 the other. The others lay stretched around them on the grass, and called out impatiently: â€œHave
 done with that and look sharp about it!â€ The two men continued to stand and play as if they were afraid
 to really set to, or were spinning the thing out for its still greater enjoyment. But suddenly Gustav
 had seized Anders by the collar, thrown himself backward and flung Anders over his head. It was done
 so quickly that Anders got no hold of Gustav; but in swinging round he got a firm grasp of Gustavâ€™s
 hair, and they both fell on their backs with their heads together and their bodies stretched in opposite
 directions. Anders had fallen heavily, and lay half unconscious, but without loosening his hold
 on Gustavâ€™s hair. Gustav twisted round and tried to get upon his feet, but could not free his head.
 Then he wriggled back into this position again as quickly as a cat, turned a backward somersault over
 his antagonist, and fell down upon him with his face toward the otherâ€™s. Anders tried to raise his
 feet to receive him, but was too late. Anders threw himself about in violent jerks, lay still and strained
 again with sudden strength to turn Gustav off, but Gustav held on. He let himself fall heavily upon
 his adversary, and sticking out his legs and arms to support him on the ground, raised himself suddenly
 and sat down again, catching Anders in the wind. All the time the thoughts of both were directed toward
 getting out their knives, and Anders, who had now fully recovered his senses, remembered distinctly
 that he had not got his. â€œAh!â€ he said aloud. â€œWhat a fool I am!â€ â€œYouâ€™re whining, are
 you?â€ said Gustav, bending his face him. â€œDo you want to ask for mercy?â€ At that moment Anders
 felt Gustavâ€™s knife pressing against his thigh, and in an instant had his hand down there and wrenched
 it free. Gustav tried to take it from him, but gave up the attempt for fear of being thrown off. He then
 confined himself to taking possession of one of Andersâ€™ hands, so that he could not open the knife,
 and began sitting upon him in the region of his stomach. Anders lay in half surrender, and bore the
 blows without trying to defend himself, only gasping at each one. With his left hand he was working
 eagerly to get the knife opened against the ground, and suddenly plunged it into Gustav just as the
 latter had risen to let himself fall heavily upon his opponentâ€™s body. Gustav seized Anders by
 the wrist, his face distorted. â€œWhat the devil are you up to now, you swine?â€ he said, spitting
 down into Andersâ€™ face. â€œHeâ€™s trying to sneak out by the back door!â€ he said, looking round
 the circle with a face wrinkled like that of a young bull. They fought desperately for the knife, using
 hands and teeth and head; and when Gustav found that he could not get possession of the weapon, he set
 to work so to guide Andersâ€™ hand that he should plunge it into his own body. He succeeded, but the
 blow was not straight, and the blade closed upon Andersâ€™ fingers, making him throw the knife from
 him with an oath. Meanwhile Erik was growing angry at no longer being the hero of the evening. â€œWill
 you soon be finished, you two cockerels, or must I have a bite too?â€ he said, trying to separate them.
 They took firm hold of one another, but then Erik grew angry, and did something for which he was ever
 after renowned. He took hold of them and set them both upon their feet. Gustav looked as if he were going
 to throw himself into the battle again, and a sullen expression overspread his face; but then he began
 to sway like a tree chopped at the roots, and sank to the ground. Bodil was the first to come to his assistance.
 With a cry she ran to him and threw her arms about him. He was carried in and laid upon his bed, Karl Johan
 poured spirit into the deep cut to clean it, and held it together while Bodil basted it with needle
 and thread from one of the menâ€™s lockers. Then they dispersed, in pairs, as friendship permitted,
 Bodil, however, remaining with Gustav. She was true to him after all. Thus the summer passed, in continued
 war and friction with the bailiff, to whom, however, they dared do nothing when it came to the point.
 Then the disease struck inward, and they set upon one another. â€œIt must come out somewhere,â€
 said Lasse, who did not like this state of things, and vowed he would leave as soon as anything else
 offered, even if they had to run away from wages and clothes and everything. â€œTheyâ€™re discontented
 with their wages, their working-hours are too long, and the food isnâ€™t good enough; they pitch
 it about and waste it until it makes one ill to see them, for anyhow itâ€™s Godâ€™s gift, even if it might
 be better. And Erikâ€™s at the bottom of it all! Heâ€™s forever boasting and bragging and stirring
 up the others the whole day long. But as soon as the bailiff is over him, he darenâ€™t do anything any
 more than the others; so they all creep into their holes. Father Lasse is not such a cowardly wind-bag
 as any of them, old though he is. â€œI suppose a good conscience is the best support. If you have it and
 have done your duty, you can look both the bailiff and the farmer â€”and God the Father, tooâ€”in the
 face. For you must always remember, laddie, not to set yourself up against those that are placed over
 you. Some of us have to be servants and others masters; how would everything go on if we who work didnâ€™t
 do our duty? You canâ€™t expect the gentlefolk to scrape up the dung in the cow-stable.â€ All this
 Lasse expounded after they had gone to bed, but Pelle had something better to do than to listen to it.
 He was sound asleep and dreaming that he was Erik himself, and was thrashing the bailiff with a big
 stick. XIV In Pelleâ€™s time, pickled herring was the Bornholmerâ€™s most important article of
 food. It was the regular breakfast dish in all classes of society, and in the lower classes it predominated
 at the supper- table tooâ€”and sometimes appeared at dinner in a slightly altered form. â€œItâ€™s
 a bad place for food,â€ people would say derisively of such-and-such a farm. â€œYou only get herring
 there twenty-one times a week.â€ When the elder was in flower, well-regulated people brought out
 their salt-boxes, according to old custom, and began to look out to sea; the herring is fattest then.
 From the sloping land, which nearly everywhere has a glimpse of the sea, people gazed out in the early
 summer mornings for the homeward-coming boats. The weather and the way the boats lay in the water
 were omens regarding the winter food. Then the report would come wandering up over the island, of
 large hauls and good bargains. The farmers drove to the town or the fishing-village with their largest
 wagons, and the herring-man worked his way up through the country from cottage to cottage with his
 horse, which was such a wretched animal that any one would have been legally justified in putting
 a bullet through its head. In the morning, when Pelle opened the stable doors to the field, the mist
 lay in every hollow like a pale gray lake, and on the high land, where the smoke rose briskly from houses
 and farms, he saw men and women coming round the gable-ends, half-dressed, or in shirt or chemise
 only, gazing out to sea. He himself ran round the out-houses and peered out toward the sea which lay
 as white as silver and took its colors from the day. The red sails were hanging motionless, and looked
 like splashes of blood in the brightness of day; the boats lay deep in the water, and were slowly making
 their way homeward in response to the beat of the oars, dragging themselves along like cows that are
 near their time for bearing. But all this had nothing to do with him and his. Stone Farm, like the poor
 of the parish, did not buy its herring until after the autumn, when it was as dry as sticks and cost almost
 nothing. At that time of year, herring was generally plentiful, and was sold for from twopence to
 twopence-halfpenny the fourscore as long as the demand continued. After that it was sold by the cartload
 as food for the pigs, or went on to the dungheap. One Sunday morning late in the autumn, a messenger
 came running from the town to Stone Farm to say that now herring was to be had. The bailiff came down
 into the servantsâ€™ room while they were at breakfast, and gave orders that all the working teams
 were to be harnessed. â€œThen youâ€™ll have to come too!â€ said Karl Johan to the two quarry drivers,
 who were married and lived up near the quarry, but came down for meals. â€œNo, our horses shanâ€™t
 come out of the stable for that!â€ said the drivers. â€œThey and we drive only stone and nothing else.â€
 They sat for a little while and indulged in sarcasms at the expense of certain people who had not even
 Sunday at their own disposal, and one of them, as he stretched himself in a particularly irritating
 way, said: â€œWell, I think Iâ€™ll go home and have a nap. Itâ€™s nice to be oneâ€™s own master once
 a week, at any rate.â€ So they went home to wife and children, and kept Sunday holiday. For a little
 while the men went about complaining; that was the regular thing. In itself they had no objection
 to make to the expedition, for it would naturally be something of a festivity. There were taverns
 enough in the town, and they would take care to arrange about that herring so that they did not get home
 much before evening. If the worst came to the worst, Erik could damage his cart in driving, and then
 they would be obliged to stay in town while it was being mended. They stood out in the stable, and turned
 their purses inside out â€”big, solid, leather purses with steel locks that could only be opened
 by pressure on a secret mechanism; but they were empty. â€œThe deuce!â€ said Mons, peering disappointedly
 into his purse. â€œNot so much as the smell of a one-Ã¶re! There must be a leak!â€ He examined the seams,
 held it close up to his eyes, and at last put his ear to it. â€œUpon my word, I seem to hear a two-krone
 talking to itself. It must be witchcraft!â€ He sighed and put his purse into his pocket. â€œYou,
 you poor devil!â€ said Anders. â€œHave you ever spoken to a two-krone? No, Iâ€™m the man for you!â€
 He hauled out a large purse. â€œIâ€™ve still got the ten-krone that the bailiff cheated me out of on
 May Day, but I havenâ€™t the heart to use it; Iâ€™m going to keep it until I grow old.â€ He put his hand
 into the empty purse and pretended to take something out and show it. The others laughed and joked,
 and all were in good spirits with the thought of the trip to town. â€œBut Erikâ€™s sure to have some
 money at the bottom of his chest!â€ said one. â€œHe works for good wages and has a rich aunt down below.â€
 â€œNo, indeed!â€ whined Erik. â€œWhy, I have to pay for half a score of young brats who canâ€™t father
 themselves upon any one else. But Karl Johan must get it, or whatâ€™s the good of being head man?â€
 â€œThatâ€™s no use,â€ said Karl Johan doubtfully. â€œIf I ask the bailiff for an advance now when
 weâ€™re going to town, heâ€™ll say â€˜noâ€™ straight out. I wonder whether the girls havenâ€™t wages
 lying by.â€ They were just coming up from the cow-stable with their milk-pails. â€œI say, girls,â€
 Erik called out to them. â€œCanâ€™t one of you lend us ten krones? She shall have twins for it next Easter;
 the sow farrows then anyhow.â€ â€œYouâ€™re a nice one to make promises!â€ said Bengta, standing
 still, and they all set down their milk-pails and talked it over. â€œI wonder whether Bodil hasnâ€™t?â€
 said Karna. â€œNo,â€ answered Maria, â€œfor she sent the ten krones she had by her to her mother the
 other day.â€ Mons dashed his cap to the floor and gave a leap. â€œIâ€™ll go up to the Old Gentleman
 himself,â€ he said. â€œThen youâ€™ll come head first down the stairs, you may be sure!â€ â€œThe
 deuce I will, with my old mother lying seriously ill in the town, without a copper to pay for doctor
 or medicine! Iâ€™m as good a child as Bodil, I hope.â€ He turned and went toward the stone steps, and
 the others stood and watched him from the stable-door, until the bailiff came and they had to busy
 themselves with the carts. Gustav walked about in his Sunday clothes with a bundle under his arm,
 and looked on. â€œWhy donâ€™t you get to work?â€ asked the bailiff. â€œGet your horses put in.â€
 â€œYou said yourself I might be free to-day,â€ said Gustav, making a grimace. He was going out with
 Bodil. â€œAh, so I did! But thatâ€™ll be one cart less. You must have a holiday another day instead.â€
 â€œI canâ€™t do that.â€ â€œWhat the deâ€”â€” And why not, may I ask?â€ â€œWell, because you gave
 me a holiday to-day.â€ â€œYes; but, confound it, man, when I now tell you you can take another day
 instead!â€ â€œNo, I canâ€™t do that.â€ â€œBut why not, man? Is there anything pressing you want
 to do?â€ â€œNo, but I have been given a holiday to-day.â€ It looked as if Gustav were grinning slyly,
 but it was only that he was turning the quid in his mouth. The bailiff stamped with anger. â€œBut I can
 go altogether if you donâ€™t care to see me,â€ said Gustav gently. The bailiff did not hear, but turned
 quickly. Experience had taught him to be deaf to that kind of offer in the busy season. He looked up
 at his window as if he had suddenly thought of something, and sprang up the stairs. They could manage
 him when they touched upon that theme, but his turn came in the winter, and then they had to keep silence
 and put up with things, so as to keep a roof over their heads during the slack time. Gustav went on strutting
 about with his bundle, without putting his hand to anything. The others laughed at him encouragingly.
 The bailiff came down again and went up to him. â€œThen put in the horses before you go,â€ he said shortly,
 â€œand Iâ€™ll drive yours.â€ An angry growl passed from man to man. â€œWeâ€™re to have the dog with
 us!â€ they said in undertones to one another, and then, so that the bailiff should hear: â€œWhereâ€™s
 the dog? Weâ€™re to have the dog with us.â€ Matters were not improved by Mons coming down the steps
 with a beautifully pious expression, and holding a ten-krone note over his chest. â€œItâ€™s all
 one now,â€ said Erik; â€œfor weâ€™ve got to have the dog with us!â€ Monsâ€™ face underwent a sudden
 change, and he began to swear. They pulled the carts about without getting anything done, and their
 eyes gleamed with anger. The bailiff came out upon the steps with his overcoat on. â€œLook sharp about
 getting the horses in!â€ he thundered. The men of Stone Farm were just as strict about their order
 of precedence as the real inhabitants of the island, and it was just as complicated. The head man sat
 at the top of the table and helped himself first, he went first in mowing and reaping, and had the first
 girl to lay the load when the hay was taken in; he was the first man up, and went first when they set out
 for the fields, and no one might throw down his tools until he had done so. After him came the second
 man, the third, and so on, and lastly the day- laborers. When no great personal preference interfered,
 the head man was as a matter of course the sweetheart of the head girl, and so on downwards; and if one
 of them left, his successor took over the relation: it was a question of equilibrium. In this, however,
 the order of precedence was often broken, but never in the matter of the horses. Gustavâ€™s horses
 were the poorest, and no power in the world would have induced the head man or Erik to drive them, let
 alone the farmer himself. The bailiff knew it, and saw how the men were enjoying themselves when Gustavâ€™s
 nags were put in. He concealed his irritation, but when they exultantly placed Gustavâ€™s cart hindmost
 in the row, it was too much for him, and he ordered it to be driven in front of the others. â€œMy horses
 arenâ€™t accustomed to go behind the tail-pullers!â€ said Karl Johan, throwing down his reins.
 It was the nickname for the last in the row. The others stood trying not to smile, and the bailiff was
 almost boiling over. â€œIf youâ€™re so bent upon being first, be it by all means,â€ he said quietly.
 â€œI can very well drive behind you.â€ â€œNo, my horses come after the head manâ€™s, not after the
 tail-pullerâ€™s,â€ said Erik. This was really a term of abuse in the way in which they used it, one
 after the other, with covert glances. If he was going to put up with this from the whole row, his position
 on the farm would be untenable. â€œYes, and mine go behind Erikâ€™s,â€ began Anders now, â€œnot
 afterâ€” after Gustavâ€™s,â€ he corrected himself quickly, for the bailiff had fixed his eyes
 upon him, and taken a step forward to knock him down. The bailiff stood silent for a moment as if listening,
 the muscles of his arms quivering. Then he sprang into the cart. â€œYouâ€™re all out of your senses
 to-day,â€ he said. â€œBut now Iâ€™m going to drive first, and the man who dares to say a word against
 it shall have one between the eyes that will send him five days into next week!â€ So saying he swung
 out of the row, and Erikâ€™s horses, which wanted to turn, received a cut from his whip that made them
 rear. Erik stormed at them. The men went about crestfallen, and gave the bailiff time to get well ahead.
 â€œWell, I suppose weâ€™d better see about starting now,â€ said Karl Johan at length, as he got into
 his wagon. The bailiff was already some way ahead; Gustavâ€™s nags were doing their very best to-day,
 and seemed to like being in front. But Karl Johanâ€™s horses were displeased, and hurried on; they
 did not approve of the new arrangement. At the village shop they made a halt, and consoled themselves
 a little. When they started again, Karl Johanâ€™s horses were refractory, and had to be quieted.
 The report of the catch had spread through the country, and carts from other farms caught them up or
 crossed them on their way to the fishing-villages. Those who lived nearer the town were already on
 their way home with swaying loads. â€œShall we meet in the town for a drink?â€ cried one man to Karl
 Johan as he passed. â€œIâ€™m coming in for another load.â€ â€œNo, weâ€™re driving for the master
 to-day!â€ answered Karl Johan, pointing to the bailiff in front. â€œYes, I see him. Heâ€™s driving
 a fine pair to-day! I thought it was King Lazarus!â€ An acquaintance of Karl Johanâ€™s came toward
 them with a swaying load of herring. He was the only man on one of the small farms. â€œSo youâ€™ve been
 to the town too for winter food,â€ said Karl Johan, reining in his horse. â€œYes, for the pigs!â€
 answered the other. â€œIt was laid in for the rest of us at the end of the summer. This isnâ€™t food for
 men!â€ And he took up a herring between his fingers, and pretended to break it in two. â€œNo, I suppose
 not for such fine gentlemen,â€ answered Karl Johan snappishly. â€œOf course, youâ€™re in such
 a high station that you eat at the same table as your master and mistress, Iâ€™ve heard.â€ â€œYes,
 thatâ€™s the regular custom at our place,â€ answered the other. â€œWe know nothing about masters
 and dogs.â€ And he drove on. The words rankled with Karl Johan, he could not help drawing comparisons.
 They had caught up the bailiff, and now the horses became unruly. They kept trying to pass and took
 every unlooked-for opportunity of pushing on, so that Karl Johan nearly drove his team into the back
 of the bailiffâ€™s cart. At last he grew tired of holding them in, and gave them the rein, when they
 pushed out over the border of the ditch and on in front of Gustavâ€™s team, danced about a little on
 the high-road, and then became quiet. Now it was Erikâ€™s horses that were mad. At the farm all the
 laborersâ€™ wives had been called in for the afternoon, the young cattle were in the enclosure, and
 Pelle ran from cottage to cottage with the message. He was to help the women together with Lasse, and
 was delighted with this break in the daily routine; it was a whole holiday for him. At dinner-time
 the men came home with their heavy loads of herring, which were turned out upon the stone paving round
 the pump in the upper yard. There had been no opportunity for them to enjoy themselves in the town,
 and they were in a bad temper. Only Mons, the ape, went about grinning all over his face. He had been
 up to his sick mother with the money for the doctor and medicine, and came back at the last minute with
 a bundle under his arm in the best of spirits. â€œThat was a medicine!â€ he said over and over again,
 smacking his lips, â€œa mighty strong medicine.â€ He had had a hard time with the bailiff before
 he got leave to go on his errand. The bailiff was a suspicious man, but it was difficult to hold out against
 Monsâ€™ trembling voice when he urged that it would be too hard on a poor man to deny him the right to
 help his sick mother. â€œBesides, she lives close by here, and perhaps I shall never see her again
 in this life,â€ said Mons mournfully. â€œAnd then thereâ€™s the money that the master advanced
 me for it. Shall I go and throw it away on drink, while sheâ€™s lying there without enough to buy bread
 with?â€ â€œWell, how was your mother?â€ asked the bailiff, when Mons came hurrying up at the last
 moment. â€œOh, she canâ€™t last much longer!â€ said Mons, with a quiver in his voice. But he was beaming
 all over his face. The others threw him angry glances while they unloaded the herring. They would
 have liked to thrash him for his infernal good luck. But they recovered when they got into their room
 and he undid the bundle. â€œThatâ€™s to you all from my sick mother!â€ he said, and drew forth a keg
 of spirits. â€œAnd I was to give you her best respects, and thank you for being so good to her little
 son.â€ â€œWhere did you go?â€ asked Erik. â€œI sat in the tavern on the harbor hill all the time,
 so as to keep an eye on you; I couldnâ€™t resist looking at you, you looked so delightfully thirsty.
 I wonder you didnâ€™t lie down flat and drink out of the sea, every man Jack of you!â€ In the afternoon
 the cottagersâ€™ wives and the farm-girls sat round the great heaps of herring by the pump, and cleaned
 the fish. Lasse and Pelle pumped water to rinse them in, and cleaned out the big salt-barrels that
 the men rolled up from the cellar; and two of the elder women were entrusted with the task of mixing.
 The bailiff walked up and down by the front steps and smoked his pipe. As a general rule, the herring-pickling
 came under the category of pleasant work, but to-day there was dissatisfaction all along the line.
 The women chattered freely as they worked, but their talk was not quite innocuousâ€”it was all carefully
 aimed; the men had made them malicious. When they laughed, there was the sound of a hidden meaning
 in their laughter. The men had to be called out and given orders about every single thing that had to
 be done; they went about it sullenly, and then at once withdrew to their rooms. But when there they
 were all the gayer, and sang and enjoyed themselves. â€œTheyâ€™re doing themselves proud in there,â€
 said Lasse, with a sigh to Pelle. â€œTheyâ€™ve got a whole keg of spirits that Mons had hidden in his
 herring. They say itâ€™s so extra uncommon good.â€ Lasse had not tasted it himself. The two kept
 out of the wrangling; they felt themselves too weak. The girls had not had the courage to refuse the
 extra Sunday work, but they were not afraid to pass little remarks, and tittered at nothing, to make
 the bailiff think it was at him. They kept on asking in a loud voice what the time was, or stopped working
 to listen to the ever-increasing gaiety in the menâ€™s rooms. Now and then a man was thrown out from
 there into the yard, and shuffled in again, shamefaced and grinning. One by one the men came sauntering
 out. They had their caps on the back of their heads now, and their gaze was fixed. They took up a position
 in the lower yard, and hung over the fence, looking at the girls, every now and then bursting into a
 laugh and stopping suddenly, with a frightened glance at the bailiff. The bailiff was walking up
 and down by the steps. He had laid aside his pipe and become calmer; and when the men came out, he was
 cracking a whip and exercising himself in self-restraint. â€œIf I liked I could bend him until both
 ends met!â€ he heard Erik say aloud in the middle of a conversation. The bailiff earnestly wished
 that Erik would make the attempt. His muscles were burning under this unsatisfied desire to let himself
 go; but his brain was reveling in visions of fights, he was grappling with the whole flock and going
 through all the details of the battle. He had gone through these battles so often, especially of late;
 he had thought out all the difficult situations, and there was not a place in all Stone Farm in which
 the things that would serve as weapons were not known to him. â€œWhatâ€™s the time?â€ asked one of
 the girls aloud for at least the twentieth time. â€œA little longer than your chemise,â€ answered
 Erik promptly. The girls laughed. â€œOh, nonsense! Tell us what it really is!â€ exclaimed another.
 â€œA quarter to the millerâ€™s girl,â€ answered Anders. â€œOh, what fools you are! Canâ€™t you
 answer properly? You, Karl Johan!â€ â€œItâ€™s short!â€ said Karl Johan gravely. â€œNo, seriously
 now, Iâ€™ll tell you what it is,â€ exclaimed Mons innocently, drawing a great â€œturnipâ€ out
 of his pocket. â€œItâ€™sâ€”â€ he looked carefully at the watch, and moved his lips as if calculating.
 â€œThe deuce!â€ he exclaimed, bringing down his hand in amazement on the fence. â€œWhy, itâ€™s
 exactly the same time as it was this time yesterday.â€ The jest was an old one, but the women screamed
 with laughter; for Mons was the jester. â€œNever mind about the time,â€ said the bailiff, coming
 up. â€œBut try and get through your work.â€ â€œNo, timeâ€™s for tailors and shoemakers, not for
 honest people!â€ said Anders in an undertone. The bailiff turned upon him as quick as a cat, and Andersâ€™
 arm darted up above his head bent as if to ward off a blow. The bailiff merely expectorated with a scornful
 smile, and began his pacing up and down afresh, and Anders stood there, red to the roots of his hair,
 and not knowing what to do with his eyes. He scratched the back of his head once or twice, but that could
 not explain away that strange movement of his arm. The others were laughing at him, so he hitched up
 his trousers and sauntered down toward the menâ€™s rooms, while the women screamed with laughter,
 and the men laid their heads upon the fence and shook with merriment. So the day passed, with endless
 ill-natured jesting and spitefulness. In the evening the men wandered out to indulge in horse-play
 on the high-road and annoy the passersby. Lasse and Pelle were tired, and went early to bed. â€œThank
 God weâ€™ve got through this day!â€ said Lasse, when he had got into bed. â€œItâ€™s been a regular
 bad day. Itâ€™s a miracle that no bloodâ€™s been shed; there was a time when the bailiff looked as if
 he might do anything. But Erik must know far he can venture.â€ Next morning everything seemed to
 be forgotten. The men attended to the horses as usual, and at six oâ€™clock went out into the field
 for a third mowing of clover. They looked blear-eyed, heavy and dull. The keg lay outside the stable-door
 empty; and as they went past they kicked it. Pelle helped with the herring to-day too, but he no longer
 found it amusing. He was longing already to be out in the open with his cattle; and here he had to be at
 everybodyâ€™s beck and call. As often as he dared, he made some pretext for going outside the farm,
 for that helped to make the time pass. Later in the morning, while the men were mowing the thin clover,
 Erik flung down his scythe so that it rebounded with a ringing sound from the swaths. The others stopped
 their work. â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with you, Erik?â€ asked Karl Johan. â€œHave you got a bee in your
 bonnet?â€ Erik stood with his knife in his hand, feeling its edge, and neither heard nor saw. Then
 he turned up his face and frowned at the sky; his eyes seemed to have sunk into his head and become blind,
 and his lips stood out thick. He muttered a few inarticulate sounds, and started up toward the farm.
 The others stood still and followed him with staring eyes; then one after another they threw down
 their scythes and moved away, only Karl Johan remaining where he was. Pelle had just come out to the
 enclosure to see that none of the young cattle had broken their way out. When he saw the men coming up
 toward the farm in a straggling file like a herd of cattle on the move, he suspected something was wrong
 and ran in. â€œThe men are coming up as fast as they can, father!â€ he whispered. â€œTheyâ€™re surely
 not going to do it?â€ said Lasse, beginning to tremble. The bailiff was carrying things from his
 room down to the pony- carriage; he was going to drive to the town. He had his arms full when Erik appeared
 at the big, open gate below, with distorted face and a large, broad-bladed knife in his hand. â€œWhere
 the devil is he?â€ he said aloud, and circled round once with bent head, like an angry bull, and then
 walked up through the fence straight toward the bailiff. The latter started when he saw him and, through
 the gate, the others coming up full speed behind him. He measured the distance to the steps, but changed
 his mind, and advanced toward Erik, keeping behind the wagon and watching every movement that Erik
 made, while he tried to find a weapon. Erik followed him round the wagon, grinding his teeth and turning
 his eyes obliquely up at his opponent. The bailiff went round and round the wagon and made half movements;
 he could not decide what to do. But then the others came up and blocked his way. His face turned white
 with fear, and he tore a whiffletree from the wagon, which with a push he sent rolling into the thick
 of them, so that they fell back in confusion. This made an open space between him and Erik, and Erik
 sprang quickly over the pole, with his knife ready to strike; but as he sprang, the whiffletree descended
 upon his head. The knife-thrust fell upon the bailiffâ€™s shoulder, but it was feeble, and the knife
 just grazed his side as Erik sank to the ground. The others stood staring in bewilderment. â€œCarry
 him down to the mangling-cellar!â€ cried the bailiff in a commanding tone, and the men dropped their
 knives and obeyed. The battle had stirred Pelleâ€™s blood into a tumult, and he was standing by the
 pump, jumping up and down. Lasse had to take a firm hold of him, for it looked as if he would throw himself
 into the fight. Then when the great strong Erik sank to the ground insensible from a blow on the head,
 he began to jump as if he had St. Vitusâ€™s Dance. He jumped into the air with drooping head, and let
 himself fall heavily, all the time uttering short, shrill bursts of laughter. Lasse spoke to him
 angrily, thinking it was unnecessarily foolish behavior on his part; and then he picked him up and
 held him firmly in his hands, while the little fellow trembled all over his body in his efforts to free
 himself and go on with his jumping. â€œWhat can be wrong with him?â€ said Lasse tearfully to the cottagersâ€™
 wives. â€œOh dear, what shall I do?â€ He carried him down to their room in a sad state of mind, because
 the moon was waning, and it would never pass off! Down in the mangling-cellar they were busy with Erik,
 pouring brandy into his mouth and bathing his head with vinegar. Kongstrup was not at home, but the
 mistress herself was down there, wringing her hands and cursing Stone Farmâ€”her own childhoodâ€™s
 home! Stone Farm had become a hell with its murder and debauchery! she said, without caring that they
 were all standing round her and heard every word. The bailiff had driven quickly off in the pony-carriage
 to fetch a doctor and to report what he had done in defence of his life. The women stood round the pump
 and gossiped, while the men and girls wandered about in confusion; there was no one to issue orders.
 But then the mistress came out on to the steps and looked at them for a little, and they all found something
 to do. Hers were piercing eyes! The old women shook themselves and went back to their work. It reminded
 them so pleasantly of old times, when the master of the Stone Farm of their youth rushed up with anger
 in his eyes when they were idling. Down in their room, Lasse sat watching Pelle, who lay talking and
 laughing in delirium, so that his father hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry. XV â€œShe must have
 had right on her side, for he never said a cross word when she started off with her complaints and reproaches,
 and them so loud that you could hear them right through the walls and down in the servantsâ€™ room and
 all over the farm. But it was stupid of her all the same, for she only drove him distracted and sent him
 away. And how will it go with a farm in the long run, when the farmer spends all his time on the high-roads
 because he canâ€™t stay at home? Itâ€™s a poor sort of affection that drives the man away from his home.â€
 Lasse was standing in the stable on Sunday evening talking to the women about it while they milked.
 Pelle was there too, busy with his own affairs, but listening to what was said. â€œBut she wasnâ€™t
 altogether stupid either,â€ said Thatcher Holmâ€™s wife. â€œFor instance when she had Fair Maria
 in to do housemaidâ€™s work, so that he could have a pretty face to look at at home. She knew that if you
 have food at home you donâ€™t go out for it. But of course it all led to nothing when she couldnâ€™t leave
 off frightening him out of the house with her crying and her drinking.â€ â€œIâ€™m sure he drinks
 too!â€ said Pelle shortly. â€œYes, of course he gets drunk now and then,â€ said Lasse in a reproving
 tone. â€œBut heâ€™s a man, you see, and may have his reasons besides. But itâ€™s ill when a woman takes
 to drinking.â€ Lasse was cross. The boy was beginning to have opinions of his own pretty well on everything,
 and was always joining in when grown people were talking. â€œI maintainâ€â€”he went on, turning
 again to the womenâ€”â€œthat heâ€™d be a good husband, if only he wasnâ€™t worried with crying and
 a bad conscience. Things go very well too when heâ€™s away. Heâ€™s at home pretty well every day, and
 looks after things himself, so that the bailiffâ€™s quite upset, for _he_ likes to be king of the castle.
 To all of us, the masterâ€™s like one of ourselves; heâ€™s even forgotten the grudge he had against
 Gustav.â€ â€œThere canâ€™t be very much to bear him a grudge for, unless it is that heâ€™ll get a wife
 with money. They say Bodilâ€™s saved more than a hundred krones from her two or three months as housemaid.
 Some people canâ€”they get paid for what the rest of us have always had to do for nothing.â€ It was
 one of the old women who spoke. â€œWell, weâ€™ll just see whether he ever gets her for a wife. I doubt
 it myself. One oughtnâ€™t to speak evil of oneâ€™s fellow-servant, but Bodilâ€™s not a faithful
 girl. That matter with the master must go for what it wasâ€”as I once said to Gustav when he was raging
 about it; the master comes before his men! Bengta was a good wife to me in every way, but she too was very
 fond of laying herself out for the landlord at home. The greatest take first; thatâ€™s the way of the
 world! But Bodilâ€™s never of the same mind for long together. Now sheâ€™s carrying on with the pupil,
 though heâ€™s not sixteen yet, and takes presents from him. Gustav should get out of it in time; it
 always leads to misfortune when love gets into a person. Weâ€™ve got an example of that at the farm
 here.â€ â€œI was talking to some one the other day who thought that the mistress hadnâ€™t gone to
 Copenhagen at all, but was with relations in the south. Sheâ€™s run away from him, youâ€™ll see!â€
 â€œThatâ€™s the genteel thing to do nowadays, it seems!â€ said Lasse. â€œIf only sheâ€™ll stay
 away! Things are much better as they are.â€ An altogether different atmosphere seemed to fill Stone
 Farm. The dismal feeling was gone; no wailing tones came from the house and settled upon one like horse
 flies and black care. The change was most apparent in the farmer. He looked ten or twenty years younger,
 and joked good-humoredly like one freed from chains and fetters. He took an interest in the work of
 the farm, drove to the quarry two or three times a day in his gig, was present whenever a new piece of
 work was started, and would often throw off his coat and take a hand in it. Fair Maria laid his table
 and made his bed, and he was not afraid of showing his kindness for her. His good humor was infectious
 and made everything pleasanter. But it could not be denied that Lasse had his own burden to bear. His
 anxiety to get married grew greater with the arrival of very cold weather as early as December; he
 longed to have his feet under his own table, and have a woman to himself who should be everything to
 him. He had not entirely given up thoughts of Karna yet, but he had promised Thatcher Holmâ€™s wife
 ten krones down if she could find some one that would do for him. He had really put the whole matter out
 of his head as an impossibility, and had passed into the land of old age; but what was the use of shutting
 yourself in, when you were all the time looking for doors through which to slip out again? Lasse looked
 out once more, and as usual it was Pelle who brought life and joy to the house. Down in the outskirts
 of the fishing-village there lived a woman, whose husband had gone to sea and had not been heard of
 for a good many years. Two or three times on his way to and from school, Pelle had sought shelter from
 the weather in her porch, and they had gradually become good friends; he performed little services
 for her, and received a cup of hot coffee in return. When the cold was very bitter, she always called
 him in; and then she would tell him about the sea and about her good-for-nothing husband, who kept
 away and left her to toil for her living by mending nets for the fishermen. In return Pelle felt bound
 to tell her about Father Lasse, and Mother Bengta who lay at home in the churchyard at Tommelilla.
 The talk never came to much more, for she always returned to her husband who had gone away and left her
 a widow. â€œI suppose heâ€™s drowned,â€ Pelle would say. â€œNo, he isnâ€™t, for Iâ€™ve had no warning,â€
 she answered decidedly, always in the same words. Pelle repeated it all to his father, who was very
 much interested. â€œWell, did you run in to Madam Olsen to-day?â€ was the first thing he said when
 the boy came in from school; and then Pelle had to tell him every detail several times over. It could
 never be too circumstantially told for Lasse. â€œYouâ€™ve told her, I suppose, that Mother Bengtaâ€™s
 dead? Yes, of course you have! Well, what did she ask about me to-day? Does she know about the legacy?â€
 (Lasse had recently had twenty-five krones left him by an uncle.) â€œYou might very well let fall
 a word or two about that, so that she shouldnâ€™t think weâ€™re quite paupers.â€ Pelle was the bearer
 of ambiguous messages backward and forward. From Lasse he took little things in return for her kindness
 to himself, such as embroidered handkerchiefs and a fine silk kerchief, the last remnants of Mother
 Bengtaâ€™s effects. It would be hard to lose them if this new chance failed, for then there would be
 no memories to fall back upon. But Lasse staked everything upon one card. One day Pelle brought word
 that warning had come to Madam Olsen. She had been awakened in the night by a big black dog that stood
 gasping at the head of her bed. Its eyes shone in the darkness, and she heard the water dripping from
 its fur. She understood that it must be the shipâ€™s dog with a message for her, and went to the window;
 and out in the moonlight on the sea she saw a ship sailing with all sail set. She stood high, and you could
 see the sea and sky right through her. Over the bulwark hung her husband and the others, and they were
 transparent; and the salt water was dripping from their hair and beards and running down the side
 of the ship. In the evening Lasse put on his best clothes. â€œAre we going out this evening?â€ asked
 Pelle in glad surprise. â€œNoâ€”well, thatâ€™s to say I am, just a little errand. If any one asks after
 me, you must say that Iâ€™ve gone to the smith about a new nose-ring for the bull.â€ â€œAnd maynâ€™t
 I go with you?â€ asked Pelle on the verge of tears. â€œNo, you must be good and stay at home for this
 once.â€ Lasse patted him on the head. â€œWhere are you going then?â€ â€œIâ€™m goingâ€”â€ Lasse
 was about to make up a lie about it, but had not the heart to do it. â€œYou mustnâ€™t ask me!â€ he said.
 â€œShall I know another day, then, without asking?â€ â€œYes, you shall, for certainâ€”sure!â€
 Lasse went out, but came back again. Pelle was sitting on the edge of the bed, crying; it was the first
 time Father Lasse had gone out without taking him with him. â€œNow you must be a good boy and go to bed,â€
 he said gravely. â€œOr else I shall stay at home with you; but if I do, it may spoil things for us both.â€
 So Pelle thought better of it and began to undress; and at last Lasse got off. When Lasse reached Madam
 Olsenâ€™s house, it was shut up and in darkness. He recognized it easily from Pelleâ€™s descriptions,
 and walked round it two or three times to see how the walls stood. Both timber and plaster looked good,
 and there was a fair-sized piece of ground belonging to it, just big enough to allow of its being attended
 to on Sundays, so that one could work for a daily wage on weekdays. Lasse knocked at the door, and a little
 while after a white form appeared at the window, and asked who was there. â€œItâ€™s Pelleâ€™s father,
 Lasse Karlsson,â€ said Lasse, stepping out into the moonlight. The door was unbolted, and a soft
 voice said: â€œCome inside! Donâ€™t stand out there in the cold!â€ and Lasse stepped over the threshold.
 There was a smell of sleep in the room, and Lasse had an idea where the alcove was, but could see nothing.
 He heard the breathing as of a stout person drawing on stockings. Then she struck a match and lighted
 the lamp. They shook hands, and looked at one another as they did so. She wore a skirt of striped bed-ticking,
 which kept her night-jacket together, and had a blue night-cap on her head. She had strong-looking
 limbs and a good bust, and her face gave a good impression. She was the kind of woman that would not hurt
 a fly if she were not put upon; but she was not a toilerâ€”she was too soft for that. â€œSo this is Pelleâ€™s
 father!â€ she said. â€œItâ€™s a young son youâ€™ve got. But do sit down!â€ Lasse blinked his eyes
 a little. He had been afraid that she would think him old. â€œYes, heâ€™s what youâ€™d call a late-born
 child; but Iâ€™m still able to do a manâ€™s work in more ways than one.â€ She laughed while she busied
 herself in placing on the table cold bacon and pork sausage, a dram, bread and a saucer of dripping.
 â€œBut now you must eat!â€ she said. â€œThatâ€™s what a manâ€™s known by. And youâ€™ve come a long
 way.â€ It only now occurred to Lasse that he must give some excuse for his visit. â€œI ought really
 to be going again at once. I only wanted to come down and thank you for your kindness to the boy.â€ He
 even got up as if to go. â€œOh, but what nonsense!â€ she exclaimed, pushing him down into his chair
 again. â€œItâ€™s very plain, but do take some.â€ She pressed the knife into his hand, and eagerly
 pushed the food in front of him. Her whole person radiated warmth and kind-heartedness as she stood
 close to him and attended to his wants; and Lasse enjoyed it all. â€œYou must have been a good wife to
 your husband,â€ he said. â€œYes, thatâ€™s true enough!â€ she said, as she sat down and looked frankly
 at him. â€œHe got all that he could want, and almost more, when he was on shore. He stayed in bed until
 dinner, and I looked after him like a little child; but he never gave me a handâ€™s turn for it, and at
 last one gets tired.â€ â€œThat was wrong of him,â€ said Lasse; â€œfor one good action deserves
 another. I donâ€™t think Bengta would have anything like that to say of me if she was asked.â€ â€œWell,
 thereâ€™s certainly plenty to do in a house, when thereâ€™s a man that has the will to help. Iâ€™ve
 only one cow, of course, for I canâ€™t manage more; but two might very well be kept, and thereâ€™s no
 debt on the place.â€ â€œIâ€™m only a poor devil compared to you!â€ said Lasse despondently. â€œAltogether
 Iâ€™ve got fifty krones, and we both have decent clothes to put on; but beyond that Iâ€™ve only got
 a pair of good hands.â€ â€œAnd Iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s worth a good deal! And I should fancy youâ€™re
 not afraid of fetching a pail of water or that sort of thing, are you?â€ â€œNo, Iâ€™m not. And Iâ€™m
 not afraid of a cup of coffee in bed on a Sunday morning, either.â€ She laughed. â€œThen I suppose
 I ought to have a kiss!â€ she said. â€œYes, I suppose you ought,â€ said Lasse delighted, and kissed
 her. â€œAnd now we may hope for happiness and a blessing for all three of us. I know youâ€™re fond of
 the laddie.â€ There still remained several things to discuss, there was coffee to be drunk, and
 Lasse had to see the cow and the way the house was arranged. In the meantime it had grown late. â€œYouâ€™d
 better stay here for the night,â€ said Madam Olsen. Lasse stood wavering. There was the boy sleeping
 alone, and he had to be at the farm by four oâ€™clock; but it was cold outside, and here it was so warm
 and comfortable in every way. â€œYes, perhaps Iâ€™d better,â€ he said, laying down his hat and coat
 again. When at about four he crept into the cow-stable from the back, the lantern was still burning
 in the herdsmanâ€™s room. Lasse thought he was discovered, and began to tremble; it was a criminal
 and unjustifiable action to be away from the herd a whole night. But it was only Pelle, who lay huddled
 up upon the chest asleep, with his clothes on. His face was black and swollen with crying. All that
 day there was something reserved, almost hostile, about Pelleâ€™s behavior, and Lasse suffered
 under it. There was nothing for it; he must speak out. â€œItâ€™s all settled now, Pelle,â€ he said
 at last. â€œWeâ€™re going to have a house and home, and a nice-looking mother into the bargain. Itâ€™s
 Madam Olsen. Are you satisfied now?â€ Pelle had nothing against it. â€œThen may I come with you next
 time?â€ he asked, still a little sullen. â€œYes, next time you shall go with me. I think itâ€™ll be
 on Sunday. Weâ€™ll ask leave to go out early, and pay her a visit.â€ Lasse said this with a peculiar
 flourish; he had become more erect. Pelle went with him on Sunday; they were free from the middle of
 the afternoon. But after that it would not have done to ask for leave very soon again. Pelle saw his
 future mother nearly every day, but it was more difficult for Lasse. When the longing to see his sweetheart
 came over him too strongly, he fussed over Pelle until the boy fell asleep, and then changed his clothes
 and stole out. After a wakeful night such as one of these, he was not up to his work, and went about stumbling
 over his own feet; but his eyes shone with a youthful light, as if he had concluded a secret treaty with
 lifeâ€™s most powerful forces. XVI Erik was standing on the front steps, with stooping shoulders
 and face half turned toward the wall. He stationed himself there every morning at about four, and
 waited for the bailiff to come down. It was now six, and had just begun to grow light. Lasse and Pelle
 had finished cleaning out the cow-stable and distributing the first feed, and they were hungry.
 They were standing at the door of the stable, waiting for the breakfast-bell to ring; and at the doors
 of the horse-stables, the men were doing the same. At a quarter-past the hour they went toward the
 basement, with Karl Johan at their head, and Lasse and Pelle also turned out and hurried to the servantsâ€™
 room, with every sign of a good appetite. â€œNow, Erik, weâ€™re going down to breakfast!â€ shouted
 Karl Johan as they passed, and Erik came out of his corner by the steps, and shuffled along after them.
 There was nothing the matter with his digestive powers at any rate. They ate their herring in silence;
 the food stopped their mouths completely. When they had finished, the head man knocked on the table
 with the handle of his knife, and Karna came in with two dishes of porridge and a pile of bread-and-dripping.
 â€œWhereâ€™s Bodil to-day?â€ asked Gustav. â€œHow should I know? Her bed was standing untouched
 this morning,â€ answered Karna, with an exulting look. â€œItâ€™s a lie!â€ cried Gustav, bringing
 down his spoon with a bang upon the table. â€œYou can go into her room and see for yourself; you know
 the way!â€ said Karna tartly. â€œAnd whatâ€™s become of the pupil to-day, as he hasnâ€™t rung?â€
 said Karl Johan. â€œHave any of you girls seen him?â€ â€œNo, I expect heâ€™s overslept himself,â€
 cried Bengta from the wash-house. â€œAnd so he may! _I_ donâ€™t want to run up and shake life into him
 every morning!â€ â€œDonâ€™t you think youâ€™d better go up and wake him, Gustav?â€ said Anders
 with a wink. â€œYou might see something funny.â€ The others laughed a little. â€œIf I wake him, itâ€™ll
 be with this rabbit-skinner,â€ answered Gustav, exhibiting a large knife. â€œFor then I think
 I should put him out of harmâ€™s way.â€ At this point the farmer himself came down. He held a piece
 of paper in his hand, and appeared to be in high good humor. â€œHave you heard the latest news, good
 people? At dead of night Hans Peter has eloped with Bodil!â€ â€œMy word! Are the babes and sucklings
 beginning now?â€ exclaimed Lasse with self-assurance. â€œI shall have to look after Pelle there,
 and see that he doesnâ€™t run away with Karna. Sheâ€™s fond of young people.â€ Lasse felt himself
 to be the man of the company, and was not afraid of giving a hit at any one. â€œHans Peter is fifteen,â€
 said Kongstrup reprovingly, â€œand passion rages in his heart.â€ He said this with such comical
 gravity that they all burst into laughter, except Gustav, who sat blinking his eyes and nodding his
 head like a drunken man. â€œYou shall hear what he says. This lay upon his bed.â€ Kongstrup held the
 paper out in a theatrical attitude and read: â€œWhen you read this, I shall have gone forever. Bodil
 and I have agreed to run away to-night. My stern father will never give his consent to our union, and
 therefore we will enjoy the happiness of our love in a secret place where no one can find us. It will
 be doing a great wrong to look for us, for we have determined to die together rather than fall into the
 wicked hands of our enemies. I wet this paper with Bodilâ€™s and my own tears. But you must not condemn
 me for my last desperate step, as I can do nothing else for the sake of my great love. â€œHANS PETER.â€
 â€œThat fellow reads story-books,â€ said Karl Johan. â€œHeâ€™ll do great things some day.â€
 â€œYes, he knows exactly whatâ€™s required for an elopement,â€ answered Kongstrup merrily. â€œEven
 to a ladder, which heâ€™s dragged up to the girlâ€™s window, although itâ€™s on a level with the ground.
 I wish he were only half as thorough in his agriculture.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s to be done now? I suppose they
 must be searched for?â€ asked the head man. â€œWell, I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s almost a shame to disturb
 their young happiness. Theyâ€™ll come of their own accord when they get hungry. What do you think,
 Gustav? Shall we organize a battue?â€ Gustav made no answer, but rose abruptly and went across to
 the menâ€™s rooms. When the others followed him, they found him in bed. All day he lay there and never
 uttered a syllable when any one came in to him. Meanwhile the work suffered, and the bailiff was angry.
 He did not at all like the new way Kongstrup was introducingâ€”with liberty for every one to say and
 do exactly as they liked. â€œGo in and pull Gustav out of bed!â€ he said, in the afternoon, when they
 were in the threshing-barn, winnowing grain. â€œAnd if he wonâ€™t put his own clothes on, dress him
 by force.â€ But Kongstrup, who was there himself, entering the weight, interfered. â€œNo, if heâ€™s
 ill he must be allowed to keep his bed,â€ he said. â€œBut itâ€™s our duty to do something to cure him.â€
 â€œHow about a mustard-plaster?â€ suggested Mons, with a defiant glance at the bailiff. Kongstrup
 rubbed his hands with delight. â€œYes, thatâ€™ll be splendid!â€ he said. â€œGo you across, Mons,
 and get the girls to make a mustard- plaster that we can stick on the pit of his stomach; thatâ€™s where
 the pain is.â€ When Mons came back with the plaster, they went up in a procession to put it on, the farmer
 himself leading. Kongstrup was well aware of the bailiffâ€™s angry looks, which plainly said, â€œAnother
 waste of work for the sake of a foolish prank!â€ But he was inclined for a little fun, and the work would
 get done somehow. Gustav had smelt a rat, for when they arrived he was dressed. For the rest of the day
 he did his work, but nothing could draw a smile out of him. He was like a man moonstruck. A few days later
 a cart drove up to Stone Farm. In the driving-seat sat a broad-shouldered farmer in a fur coat, and
 beside him, wrapped up from head to foot, sat Hans Peter, while at the back, on the floor of the cart,
 lay the pretty Bodil on a little hay, shivering with cold. It was the pupilâ€™s father who had brought
 back the two fugitives, whom he had found in lodgings in the town. Up in the office Hans Peter received
 a thrashing that could be heard, and was then let out into the yard, where he wandered about crying
 and ashamed, until he began to play with Pelle behind the cow-stable. Bodil was treated more severely.
 It must have been the strange farmer who required that she should be instantly dismissed, for Kongstrup
 was not usually a hard man. She had to pack her things, and after dinner was driven away. She looked
 good and gentle as she always did; one would have thought she was a perfect angelâ€”if one had not known
 better. Next morning Gustavâ€™s bed was empty. He had vanished completely, with chest, wooden shoes
 and everything. Lasse looked on at all this with a manâ€™s indulgent smileâ€”childrenâ€™s tricks!
 All that was wanting now was that Karna should squeeze her fat body through the basement window one
 night, and she too disappear like smokeâ€”on the hunt for Gustav. This did not happen, however; and
 she became kindly disposed toward Lasse again, saw after his and Pelleâ€™s clothes, and tried to
 make them comfortable. Lasse was not blind; he saw very well which way the wind blew, and enjoyed the
 consciousness of his power. There were now two that he could have whenever he pleased; he only had
 to stretch out his hand, and the women-folk snatched at it. He went about all day in a state of joyful
 intoxication, and there were days in which he was in such an elevated condition of mind that he had
 inward promptings to make use of his opportunity. He had always trodden his path in this world so sedately,
 done his duty and lived his life in such unwavering decency. Why should not he too for once let things
 go, and try to leap through the fiery hoops? There was a tempting development of power in the thought.
 But the uprightness in him triumphed. He had always kept to the one, as the Scriptures commanded,
 and he would continue to do so. The other thing was only for the greatâ€”Abraham, of whom Pelle had
 begun to tell him, and Kongstrup. Pelle, too, must never be able to say anything against his father
 in that way; he must be clean in his childâ€™s eyes, and be able to look him in the face without shrinking.
 And thenâ€”well, the thought of how the two women would take it in the event of its being discovered,
 simply made Lasse blink his red eyes and hang his head. Towards the middle of March, Fru Kongstrup
 returned unexpectedly. The farmer was getting along very comfortably without her, and her coming
 took him rather by surprise. Fair Maria was instantly turned out and sent down to the wash-house.
 Her not being sent away altogether was due to the fact that there was a shortage of maids at the farm
 now that Bodil had left. The mistress had brought a young relative with her, who was to keep her company
 and help her in the house. They appeared to get on very well together. Kongstrup stayed at home upon
 the farm and was steady. The three drove out together, and the mistress was always hanging on his arm
 when they went about showing the place to the young lady. It was easy to see why she had come home; she
 could not live without him! But Kongstrup did not seem to be nearly so pleased about it. He had put away
 his high spirits and retired into his shell once more. When he was going about like this, he often looked
 as if there was something invisible lying in ambush for him and he was afraid of being taken unawares.
 This invisible something reached out after the others, too. Fru Kongstrup never interfered unkindly
 in anything, either directly or in a roundabout way; and yet everything became stricter. People
 no longer moved freely about the yard, but glanced up at the tall windows and hurried past. The atmosphere
 had once more that oppression about it that made one feel slack and upset and depressed. Mystery once
 again hung heavy over the roof of Stone Farm. To many generations it had stood for prosperity or misfortuneâ€”these
 had been its foundations, and still it drew to itself the constant thoughts of many people. Dark thingsâ€”terror,
 dreariness, vague suspicions of evil powersâ€”gathered there naturally as in a churchyard. And
 now it all centered round this woman, whose shadow was so heavy that everything brightened when she
 went away. Her unceasing, wailing protest against her wrongs spread darkness around and brought
 weariness with it. It was not even with the idea of submitting to the inevitable that she came back,
 but only to go on as before, with renewed strength. She could not do without him, but neither could
 she offer him anything good; she was like those beings who can live and breathe only in fire, and yet
 cry out when burnt. She writhed in the flames, and yet she herself fed them. Fair Maria was her own doing,
 and now she had brought this new relative into the house. Thus she herself made easy the path of his
 infidelity, and then shook the house above him with her complaining. An affection such as this was
 not Godâ€™s work; powers of evil had their abode in her.
