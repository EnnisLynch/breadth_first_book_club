Exercises for the reader:
Dear reader, you didn't think this code was complete did you? This repo is hot-garbage!

Your mission, should you choose to accept (and after liking and commenting on the vide and subscribing to the channel)
is to 

1) Refactor breadth_first.go to have multiple methods that adhere to the SOLID or DRY principles
2) Add appropriate unit tests to test your new methods
3) Add ability to read in book from command-line arguments
4) Add acceptance tests to test complete functionality
5) Optional: Integrate with third-party API library to automatically read the book

Have fun and good coding!
