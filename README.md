# breadth_first_book_club
Note: This code base is a companion to a YouTube educational video. I have published
this code first before publishing the video so you will see some updates with actual video links!!!!

Note: The code is currently tagged for the video, however, in editting, we may discover improvements. Thus
you might see some craziness in the commit history. Sorry, not sorry.

Breadth first book club is a companion repository to the educational video: XXXXX. 
Following along with the video using the appropriate labels in the repo

Exercises for the reader:
Dear reader, you didn't think this code was complete did you? This repo is hot-garbage!

Your mission, should you choose to accept (and after liking and commenting on the vide and subscribing to the channel)
is to 

1) Refactor breadth_first.go to have multiple methods that adhere to the SOLID or DRY principles
2) Add appropriate unit tests to test your new methods
3) Add ability to read in book from command-line arguments
4) Add acceptance tests to test complete functionality
5) Optional: Integrate with third-party API library to automatically read the book

Have fun and good coding!
